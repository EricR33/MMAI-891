12254,Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine I love the dirt that sticks to your face the sweat dripping from your forehead and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering cAPS Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates are the things you remember the most through out your softball career I have always had great memories through softball many laughs tears and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have hoOd capS CAps WAS my team name i had pLayed almost four years with this local team Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them I felt like I had my set team I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe i play for a team not as locally that idea was also very enticing I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended or play with a team I knew nothing about play with girls that might not like me girls that were so much better then me and looked down upon me As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyses everything did i really want to stay and be comfortable or maybe challenge myself to become a better player maybe i could work hard enough and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later i then decided i would take a chance and try for this team as my dad and i drove to the field where i would try out for this team my stomach was in knots i wanted this team to like me i was playing all the possible ways in my head i could greet them so i did not sound snobby or a grump the time moved quickly and i wished it would slow my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second i was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste no flavor just a sticky mess the car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ready or not here we come nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and i was second guessing every move i made i even had troubles removing my seat belt as i approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion walking by i saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived my first thought was to run that was it i did not want to go i was done i wanted home i was ready to start my year with the caps i just couldn't take it then as i walked onto the field they all grew a smile each and everyone of them told me their names there favourite colour and a small fun fact about themselves i found myself laughing through out my whole try out there were no awkward moments and i enjoyed my time there i couldn't wait to go back i now had made new friends friends i knew i would grow close with my year with this team was amazing i have friendshIps With these girls that i never would have dIscovered if i had not gone those girls are like family and the coaches even more so laughter played a very big role in the decisiOn i made to plAy with this team if i had just gone and tried out and had i not had fun and laughed i would have decided to play witH the caps i have had great memOries with the caps but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships therefore enjoying the sport as Well as the people,46
12255,sOme people like making people laugh I love it i will do most anything to get a good laugh i Will make fun of my self do insanely stupid things and sometimes hurt myself not in any serious way when i Was lIttle i did nOt really understand laughter for some odd reason i could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it i was kind of special in some areas as a kid i still am today still at the tender age of five i loved making people laugh and being special i would do even crazier things for a laugh mind you i was kind of a spa and a really big spa i was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet for example one time i hit myself in the head with a hammer another time i was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand stabbed myself in the head with it and needed stitches one of the craziest times though was a couple days before i had to take pictures and i wanted to go play outside my mon knowing how special i was i got it from her wouldn't allow me to the expert persuAsive kid i was back then convinCed her to let me go outside before i could even reach the street i fell head first on tO the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures although that might make some people laugh this is a story about laughter not me being a spa now that you know that i love making people laugh i'm special and that i'm a complete spa i can get on with the story well i was in kindergarten and i loved school because i got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks that might sound stupid but i was in kindergarten the only thing i did not like about kindergarten was bulls surprisingly i have never had a bully except kindergarten but this was a bad bully he would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see i still know the bully too but hers no bully anymore hers a goody two shoes now which i think is odd anyways kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day and every day i got a wedgies that day is what this whole story is about its why i told you i love making people laugh why i told you i'm special and a spa everything in the story circles around this one day dramatic pause in kindergarten it started out like any other day in kindergarten i woke up did my daily routine hopped in the car and headed to school when i got to school i grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign i did all my work and coloured which was basically all my work it came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack when we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time we were all in the little circle which was more like a deformed oval listening to the story right when i would get into the story and lose my guard i would receive an excruciatingly painful for a five year old wedgie the story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited the story finally finished and we were standing up and this is where my memory starts to fade i cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter me being a special spa that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears i remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears one of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke it took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing At me to This day i still get reminded by classmates about that day of course i can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten i'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me it was a negative experience then bUt it turned into a blessing in disguise it made me gRow into a better person i can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me doing Dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my fortE so remember being special could sometimes be the best thing about you what makes yoU who yOu are what makes you great what makes yoU grow what makes people lAugh,40

12261,I believe that with all people laughter and having a sense of humour is something that generally everyone has in common everyone loves to share with others aMong young teenage girls laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful its the purest kind of joy we have its somethings that brings humans together its the beginning and end of friendship and unity laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it a simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright we all know that feeling of dread and sadness the kindness generosity and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays even in poverty depression and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a persons worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth person and i have been the best of friends since we were ten years old and laughter has always been our strongest element person and i have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry weave decided that apart were just a little funny but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh we use that power on each other when were having bad days or we simply need some cheering up i think if it was not for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore it really is what brings us together as best friends wed be different people even if i drifted from her wed always be cracking jokes making each others guts hurt and tearing up from laughing so hard my first impression of person was of her stomping down to our neighbourhood park to yell at her sister whom i had been playing with at the time it would be a very self explanatory reason of why i did not like her at first luckily after going to person is house with her sister person and i found that we had many things in common and we were only four months apart that childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together for it was a bit rocky at the beginning always fighting and arguing about things that now we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize one time she proceeded to tell me that i couldn't hear her because i had a big bug in my eAr now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it we were mere numb year old is then now almost numb we rarely fight but we always laugh and make the best of what weave got with our poking fun laughter was definitely the band aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship person has a gift to make anything funny at any time she says the wrong but hilarious things but always at the right time laughter is now a necessity between us its what keeps our friendship so strong i think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life everyone knows that it was not a good day if you have not laughed or let alone smiled people would be dull and just unhappy laughter heals people from sickness it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all i truly believe that its healthy for you with a flip of a switch laughing can bring within us an ecstatic and serendipitous feeling people take it for granted and use it for wrong when its meant to spread the word of happiness were lucky to have a gift of such natural joy can anyone even explain in detail the feeling laughter truly brings us i think not its like describing the scent of something you just can't do it the words are not there i think of those poor and miserable peoplE that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh and its very sad i strive to lAugh every single day and make at least one other person laugh what is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter its no life at all for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happinesS,41

12276,In many relationships I have had there has always been laughter love sadness anger and complications although there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was weather boring and sad I would spend tremendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him hE was a rather rental soul and could never harm a fly but still could not laugh even though he was happy I would ask many times over and over are you sure your happy because you done seem like it I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown I told him with a sour face and he replied back yes CAPS I am happy but just because I don't laugh does not mean i am not and besides with that silly grin on your face how could I not be happy with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again then why cant you not laugh and he replied back in a drowsy voice because he was getting tired of the same topic everyday its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to and i said well why on earth would you do that he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic all right if you don't stop this he said in a rental but strained voice in going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year but of course he was only joking he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my best friend he couldn't not talk to me The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the dATE i Saw him it Was a cold date when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instantly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that dATE I had to figure out why he was leaving Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me I asked him and he said my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york i Begin to cry as he told me this i waS young about eight years of age and he was twelve I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lifted to school that we would hang out before he lifted That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him CAPS I know you have always wondered why I done laugh he said and went on like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I done want to I just when i Was young i Was teased because of my smile i diDst understand why would anyone tease him so I asked why though why would someone tease you your nice and he replied because before my new teeth grew in my old ones did not look so great And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me he said I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just did not feel the need to and now well i could smile and truth be told i want to i Said really with too much excitement yes and the only reason is you your about the only person that makes me want to smile its because of that grin you always have your always so happy I just couldn't admit it to myself well because your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to a mile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak i Didst understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is about al true because after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a dATE and a little laughter,33
12277,These days you don't really need a reason to laugh Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend pERSON no Matter what the situation whenever we are around each other we end up having fun lAughter can turn a bad day completely around One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago oNe of my friends tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her and hide instead of hurt her Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her sO there i stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me perSON HAd come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped sHe made me feel much better Her just being there for me and being able to remains in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared seemed to make all my problems disappear Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my friend who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with Every body has to have a somebody,38
12278,Friends agent always what we want them to be they a rent always easy to find but with a smile and a laugh a friendship can become i mean what is a friendship if there int those moments where you laugh until you pee when you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit ups of course you month meet a friend like this and it monTh happen when you least expect it i didst expect a new friendship but in a new town anD with new people i met the friend i now call best friend it was the year of numb and i was new to organization in homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks well at least that how i felt my homeroom teacher person caps me my so called schedule sixth period caps class with person what caps what is that i really had no idea what a caps was until i walked into that class i turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be i walked in and well there i found out what a caps was it was a one wheeled bike wow i laughed thinking how did i not know that i looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around i took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there when in walked a girl that looked about my age she took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her but i was to embarrassed to person asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner we started to use the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help class was over and i told her my name was person and she told me her name was caps i was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a friend well at least someone i talked to i went into the class and she was absent so i was a loner that period i had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl she didst want to ride the caps all she wanted to was talk i was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and i had it practice my unicycle in i was really hoping caps would show up to class the next day and she showed up this time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked we started practising and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall we stared at each other and just started laughing and laughing i couldn't breath and she almost peed it was one of the best times i had experienced that year and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends we are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart we love to laugh we believe that the moRe you laugh tHE YOunger you look and well i thiNK ITs true everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close i believe that in every friendship what brougHt it together was a SMile or laughter a laUGHING MOMENT WHERE YOU LAUGHED SO HARD YOU FARTED AND MILK CAME OUT OF YOUR FRIENDS NOSE ITS A GREAT TIME AND YOU NEVER FORGET IT ITS SOMETHING THAT IS SO SIMPLE BUT SO SPECIAL AND IT REALLY MARKS YOUR HEART AND THE WAY YOU FEEL AROUND THAT PERSON IT BROUGHT MY FRIENDSHIP WITH A PERSON I HAD BARLEY MET INTO A FRIENDSHIP THAT IS NOW INSEPARABLE AND AMAZING,36
12279,it was a normal bright and warm datE DAy going into my fifth grade year my oldEr sister and i had Been playing all day with my other neighbours that were around our age one of those neighbours happened to be a boy we couLd not find anything to do It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my caPS Had made he mAde it out of an old swing set seat and i thOught my neighbour would really enjoy it we all headed into our garage to get it my Sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high but i reFused it waS my idea to show him so i wouLd be the one to get it as i wAs In total concentration stretching and reaching to grab it I noticed everyone around me giggling My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at i stood there confused for a minute before i had found out what happened my sister pulled down my pants in front of our boy neighbour I picked my pants up off the ground looked straight at my sister and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists i Ran straight to my room crying all the way there My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups sHe sat on my bed waiting for a half an hour i Did not budge shE did not say anything but i Could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets latEr that night i fInally came out My sister kept on apologizing but it did not matter to me because i was upset with her that is all that mattered The whole next day passed and nothing had changed She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood mY caPS came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her i thought in my head how could she be upset but I realized I had not treated her right even though I was not happy with her afTer hearing what my capS HAd said i decIded that it was not worth it I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days sHe told me that she did not mean to hurt my feelings she was just messing around After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend We joke around like that all the time but its never in front of anyone besides family I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbour friend away but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about Even though I was embarrassed i admitted that it was pretty funny we had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off Ever since then every time it is brought up we laugh so hard tears role down our face I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened but i do now it is another memory that my sister and i Share and can reminisce about the more laughable memories you share the closer it brings you to some one,45
12280,Making someone laugh is the best feeling to their soul and it is one step closer to internal happiness People might say that when feeling something good inside the body its when they know that they have done something right i agree with this because it has happen to me I was feeling down about something that I cant even remember but when I felt the need to help someone do something I knew inside of me that I did something very special at that moment iTs amazing how you make someone laugh and it does not matter where you are you also feel happy the one person in my life that has a great sense of humour is my mother she is always in need of something funny people enjoy laughing so much that it is if they were to take some sort of energy drink to make them not want to stop laughing i hear people say that laughter is very healthy for a human soul and it will also make the soul and body last longer laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much it could be a great way to start a conversation with a person positive thinking leads to making good choices especially if happiness leads you on in life by making someone laugh it makes the awkwardness go away it is better to laugh then to be sad everyone has their addiction to something in which they need to depend on my momus addiction is laughing she laughs at work and she especially laughs at the house whenever i'm around although sometimes she feels down whenever something goes wrong i hate seeing her like this because it then makes me feel down when she is feeling sad it is if there is nothing in the world that would make her cheer up if one person is feeling depress that feeling passes on to the next person closest to them eventually i get tiered of seeing my mon like this and in this situation i cant help it but to get up and start doing some ridiculous stuff to cheer her up some things that pop into my mind is that i can start dancing funny or tell a little lie that might of happen at school that i think will cheer her up when there is an opportunity to make someone laugh i enjoy to put a smile on their face my mon means the world to me just as i mean the world to her we try to help each other in any way as possible this one day she came home from work and my dad was sitting in the table reading the newspaper and my mon walks in and notices that my dad has not made food yet she started to flip out on him she thought that it was stupid of him to not make dinner for us she was pretty angry at him for a period of time so she started to make us dinner but she was doing it all wrong she was mixing the spices in the wrong pan i was going to let her know that she was doing it all wrong but my dad was holding me back so that i wouldn't get her more angry she finally finish cookiNg and served us our plates but we did not wanted to eat it because she Made the food out of anger and made it smEll funky my dad forced us to eat it because he thought that by eating the food it would make her happy but he was wrong it only made her feel worse because my youngest brother did not like it i felt bad so i had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood to not be mad at my dad anymore i turn on the caps and changed the caps to the music caps and started to dance as if i were to have ants in my pants her lungs were about to burst because she was laughing so hard and eventually she was in a good mood for the rest of the day everywhere i go i see people smiling and laughing about something and it only makes me wonder about the funny things that are being said i think that it is a good thing for someone to feel good about themselves because it brings a positive feeling in the room i enjoy to see people be happy because it always makes me feel happy what better way to be happy when smiling is one step closer to laughing my mon and i like to take walks just so that we wouldn't feel aPart and stay closer to each other we see different people each time We go walking and we always get a smile from them that is the best feeling in the world tO feel joy is to be free from all your pRoblems,31

12282,Their are many joys in life some are more relevant then the others and some are so obvious you a be stupid no to notice them Have you ever just sat on your porch or stared out the window just to watch the sun rise as you sat there pondering your life and its unusual qualities you think of all the great memories all the laughs you have shared all the sorrows all the pain and all the love and hate Its not surprising that almost everyone has done just that and they wonder if they could change things how would they do that or would they leave it the way it started out filling their life is complete and they are complete as well not having any regrets for alL the tears i have cried and all the pain have been through there has always been a laugh to top the sadness some time i to sit and pander my life although i have not lived long and my real experiences are yet to come I have been through a great deal in my short experiences but it does not trouble me for i have taken in what has happened during my time period and I have learned a great deal form it hAve learned that no matter how hard you try you can never fully plain your life theirs always going to be something or someone unexpected all you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst Its not hard to be happy just keep an open mind and a light heart and soon you will find yourself laughing with the rest of the world and enjoying your short time on this amazing planet we call lOCATION so listen to your mother and father or even the person you look up to most in life There are many things that keep me going like my boyfriend or my love for animals but the most important thing i can think of is not just one thing its a collection of things such as love laughter new beginnings and old endings a bright and new path all you have to do is take it the relentlessness of the universe and the idea that there month be other planets out there that sustain life maybe even intelligent life iTs easy to find things to live for and even easier to find things to die for hopefully you look for things to live for I remember when it was hard and I thought I would never ever be happy and I felt like I was not right for this world and its many confusing aspects I was at the end of my path or so I was making it out to be but then something happened as I sat on the side of an old road I looked up at the stars and thought what would i miss out on if I ended my path now what would i dare to name my child or children for that matter if i even have the chance to produce any wHo would i marry if i marry will our love last or fade like morning due so I finally decided that there was to much i would not experience if I ended it this soon after that fateful evening I went about my life slowly holding into a better person who wanted a bright future with a romantically new but burning love story to tell to my child or children and with devotion trust and respect would hopefully last but that is not all i would want my adventure to consist of I would want to find peace of mind in a place where silence is a scarcity I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals not pushing them aside or abusing their natural right to be on this lOCATION along side us I want to solve the pollution problem that we humans have more then helped produce i suppose in my small way i will because in just one person and a every small thing on this very big home of ours but as small as I am what i do or say will make an impact so if I want something to look back and laugh on i had bettered to what i consider my part and making this planet a shared and healthy planet,34

12287,sOmetimes i wonder why people laugh peOple laugh when something is funny or when things capS awkward and they are not sure what else to do often people laugh when they caps embarrassed or offended i actually find myself laughing for no reason on occasion if i can make someone laugh i usually feel very accomplished i think it personally shows emotions out loud but in some cases you laugh uncontrollably at yourself every year since i moved here six and date my two cousins and my sisters and i have gone cheese ball carolina with our grandparents around caps time even after my grandpa died in date and my older sister left for college on the twenty first of date we go secret location shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand after all five of us have gone we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening we always make a list before we start the carolina first thing on the list is the people who is houses we caps going to go to that night second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house third is what song we caps going to sing to them usually there is about twenty five to thirty people on the list all of which caps family members and really close friends or people from their work we always have a really good time with it too no fighting or bickering or anything like that its really nice to just be with the family and catch up usually its been about a year since we have all been together at the same time last year was the first year we went carolina with out my older sister she went off to college the date before leaving me the oldest grand kid there at first it did not seem any different but as the day went on i could feel it taking its tole with her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably i started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun my grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name at first i did not think anything of it later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family and that is when it hit me the name looked and sounded familiar because i used to go to school with a boy with the same last name that is when i asked her to verify if it was the same family sure enough it was i had had a crush on this boy since i could remember we lost contact after i had found out he liked my cousin though i knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him not to mention embarrassing i remember thinking caps great this is just what i needed this is going to be awesome we did our rounds and everything went very smoothly we were having tons of fun making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything then it came time to go to his house we all choked up the girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too we were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine i think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever my grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened to our dismay he answered it we froze we were like gargoyles gawking at him he gave us a weird look and said caps you going to sing or just stand there with an evil little smile i did attempt to sing but nothing came out that is when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday that was not the song we had planned for this house and it was not his birthday in the middle of the second happy birthday to you we all start cracking up laughing and i don't mean giggling or a smaLl laugh we caps all laughing HYSTerically to the point where we could not breath and he shut the door i know if we would Have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful but because we all were laughing we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure i realized that night its a memory i'm sure we will never forget I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of what were you thinking moments i wouldn't change anytHING about it,40
12288,Laughter is always the key to complete happiness all you really have to do is laugh to be happy I remember back in the nUMB grade i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i did not know where anything really was it was a new school new bus new everything being the new student is something no one wants to be you get made fun of a lot and sometimes you just done fit in well that my story i never fit in one day i was walking up the stairs to my class and it was a bright sunny day i done believe there really was any clouds that day anyways as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me a because i had just fell down and caps because i was wearing dora underpants therefore i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me but to tell you the truth i laughed right along with them i honestly thought it was pretty funny falling down and your underpants show who does not think that is funny after the fact this girl named caps came up to me and told me in not the only one who wears character underpants we both laughed as hard as we could that whole day just remembering the fact that me of all people i fell down the stairs next being the new kid that could actually be taking embarrassing but for me i have done it a million times so it really did not bug me as much as people thought it would caps and i became such great friends we laughed all the time like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water or back to the time where i fell down the stairs up to this day we still talk about that its just something you really don't get over not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my character underpants showed in conclusion i think when the quote says laughter is the shortest distance between two people really is true you have to have A good laugh before you can go on with your day its just a known fact If you done laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you just because your getting older does not mean you have to throw aWay your laugh laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want so you tell me what is your Funny story,32

12296,Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone is day For whatever reason humans like to laugh and they like to make others laugh as well bUt that reminds me of a funny story There was this time that I had to take a writing test iN fact the test was very much like this one iN fact it was this one I had to write about one of four topics uNfortunately all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be and this made picking one rather challenging aFter staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so i Began to silently laugh at my situation I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting fOr some reason I found my problematic situation amusing as I am kind of weird that way bUt then it hit me one of the four topics was about laughter why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation yes All i had to do was tell a true story about a time i lauGhed so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly So now I had my topic To make things even more amusing as i wrote about myself laughing at the fact that i had to write about myself laughing I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was However I began to worry that whoever is grading these things mONTH not find this as amusing as i Did which would perhaps hurt my grade But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic and consequently amusing yoU monTH think that I am easily amused but to that i must say well yeah I kind of am i can find almost anything amusing but that i fInd is the beauty of laughter it is so abstract that each and every person experiences it in differently Some people mONTH find very simple things considerably amusing but others moNTH Be not so easily amused These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable aS i said before humans like to laugh and we like to make other people laugh with us aNd regardless of the way you moNTH interpret daughters abstract form you be got to admit its kind of funny,39

12302,ORGANIZATION is one of the many joys I love to share with people I absolutely love to laugh I don't know where i would be if I did not laugh My cousin caPS And i aRe usually together for most of the date and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks caPS Is dad persON gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to ORGANIZATION in loCATION After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster me being the one who drank most of it was the one who was staying calm capS ON the other hand who drank a couple of sips was going crazy She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it ORGANIZATION hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her weNdy persON IS wife and my second cousin started to get hungry so we went to go eat pizza at the ORGANIZATION cafe that is there my mon had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza i handed my plate to caPS Because my plate was slipping from my grip she Was holding her food in her other hand she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to person WHO Was not paying attention and he did not have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor pizza side down It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us aFter that embarrassing moment perSON realized that he forgot the churns so he told caPS To go get them All three of us realized his mistake as soon as cAPS left cause caps is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying cAPS is probably going to drop them we wEre a little surprised that she had not dropped them yet as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table one of the churns fell off the table and rolled out of the package we were organization so hard that we couldn't breathe caps was so embarrassed by her mistake thaT she turned bright red we felt bad for poor caps but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was she knew it was funny but she did not want to laugh at herself one of the things i usually say is if you can't and are not willing to laugh at yourself then you are not having fun that is why i believe it is so important to laugh cause you gotta learn how to have fun when it is in a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but yet are not wanting to that is one of the biggest ways to have fun is by ORGANIZATION because you know you made a small silly misTake that you think everyone in the world saw all you need is to laugh it off but you wont cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake sometimes its your job to go over to them pat them on the back and tell them that everybody makes mistakes you gotta learn how to be silly in a tough situation and that nobody is perfect tell them to laugh it off it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down just get back up cause that is what life is all about that is the only way you can learn from your mistakes and from life as well laughter is really important the more you laugh the better you feel and the better you feel the more fun you will have laughter fiXES everything it is a bandage for the little things that happen in life,33

12308,What makes you laugh Laughter is a really good stress reliever tHere are many different types of laughs around the world some peoples laughs are really high pitched and others month be very deep and low some other people snort and make other animal noises i know that for me i have many different types of laughs for all the different emotions i feel when i am upset i have a very distinctive laugh although when i am upset i laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day one time during a basketball game i was having a really off night fouls were being called on me left and right normally when this happens to me i get really mad and i lose my head and end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench i absolutely hate sitting on the bench this time when i got a foul called on me after already being threatened to be ejected from the previous game for the same reason i decided to just smile and laugh about the foul and told myself to shake it off my coach was very pleased with my change in attitude and just told me to play defence with my feet and to shake the bad call off and keep my head when you are mad a person can take a lot away from the demonstrative looks you can make although if you just smile and laugh about it their reactions will be a lot different i am not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way a lot of us just laugh about calls that are made and just shake them off i am also a cheerleader when you are a cheerleader you should always try to have a smile on your face at all times and make it seem like you are in a happy mood i play in a basketball game every night before i go out and cheer i have to do my best to keep my cool while playing so that i'm in a good mood for after my game when i do CHEER laughing helps me a lot with keeping my cool and relaxing while i am playing so i'm in a good mood for cheer my coach is also very huge on people having positive attitudes she tells us at practice that if we just smile and laugh about things that go wrong the outcome will be a lot better then if we have bad attitudes about it i took this in very strongly and it stayed with me my coach influenced me to have a better attitude and since that day i have tried to have a positive attitude I keep my positive attitude by just smiling and laughing when things in my life gO wrong A lauGh can go a really long way i personally think laughing helps express the mood you are in laughing is also good for the body laughing can make you feel one hundred times better when you are feeling down in the dumps i try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times i really don't like being in a bad mood its really not fun laughing makes me feel a lot better i think that laughing is a very good function for the body i feel that when i laugh it makes my mood better and the moods of the people around me a lot better laughing is a magical feeling that goes through out your body and makes you feel warm inside i think everyone should laugh at Least once a dAy it will make your day that much better,37

12311,lAughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you be just met and growing closer to people you care about in my opinion caps brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down getting enough bravery to gain new friends ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her is where laughter played an important role caps was the date i was fifteen and a sophomore at organization school caps was my first year there i have been to many schools location caps wood etc and like any new school i was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers everyday i woke up got ready went to school got home did homework maybe and went to bed caps was a boring cycle that i seemed to be trapped in the image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much because one thing i realized was that trying to be cool and something you re not only gets you so far the one thing that kids people in general like is when you re real and being yourself i found that out later on but i actually did not realize that is what people liked the most i said to myself one time that i did not like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was i actually thought that i was a cool person deep down so i changed my ways i stopped trying to act cool and acted like myself and caps turned out that i actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable my main attribute well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile caps gained me many friends that i did not have in the beginning caps even gained me one of the most beautiful girl i had ever seen her name was location in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way she had the body of a coca cola bottle caramel skin and the face of a goddess and i'm not exaggerating like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me so what chance did i have what did i person have to offer her laughter my greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times even though caps did not last as long as i would have liked caps forever caps was great being with her for as long as i did the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together are priceless and caps was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face i believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that caps is today sure there is still crime and many horrors and atrocities committed today but imagine how horrid caps would be without laughter joy which i believe is the core of what laughter brings allows us to forgive and forget caps allows us to turn our heads and overlook things without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future,40

12314,The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure sHadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me Everything that could go wrong did go wrong anD the rest of my night was only going to get worse Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated rEsulting in her calling me as soon as i sat down on my bed The words we exchanged left soldering wreckage in our wake Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones Once I laid back down in my bed and my anger diminished I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt i Said things that were unnecessary and horrible as I lAid on my bed my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force iT laboured my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house and stealing whatever valuables I had left mY day had ended in tears and pain buT then my phone rang once more Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller Id i Turned out to be my best friend and so I answered not knowing what cAPS wanted caps asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch wHen caPS pulled into my driveway i was there waiting for him i Climbed into the passengers seat and immediately caps knew something was wrong caPS asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer perSON CAps knew that it was not the right time to talk about it and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee caPS Did the same but with much less force then caps cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession bRinging a storm of swearing and profane language My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists clenched we Sat there in silence for a short time while caps CHOse his words carefully then cAps decided to change the subject for the time being because cAPS saw that I was still squeezing my car keys caPS asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth wE became silent again and then caPS asked me capS YOu feel better now that you got it all out I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected After thinking about it I replied yes We then enjoyed our dinner payed and left my Mood had been lifted but i waS still upset So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car caPS and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water caPS then asked if I wanted to hear a joke and after a pause i said yes The joke cAPS told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard i Had trouble breathing his timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar I have always turned to my friends when I felt down And there have always been there proving I can count on them thAt day had been a disaster but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then i hAd hoped it iS not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood but it is also important that they make me laugh bEcause if your counting on someone to brighten your day what better way to capS it ten make them laugh lAughter has always held important meaning in my life I laugh every day mOstly because i find the most idiotic things hilarious I know that laughter will never disappear i hope that one day when i am old and decrepit all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends bEcause laughter is magical It can make a sad man glad make sunshine on a cloudy day and make light of the darkest situations,42
12315,Being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend Everyone has their flaws a friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry Making someone laugh can always help when they think that its not possible for their life to get any worse laughter is the most valued gift that can be given you know inside that its making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face there have been many times in my life where i have laughed so hard that i cried there is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter i laugh a lot throughout the day when i don't people get suspicious and they feel like there is something wrong with me that is literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life laughing is my second language in life there has been one time in particular in my lifE span so far that has made me laugh so hard that i cried tremendously hard my friends were staying the time at my house and we were just being boys we did so many things that mad us question our sanity we at hot sauce by the spoon full we watched comedy shows and we also ate ourselves sick it was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all while watching the comedy shows we couldn't breath we were laughing so hard nothing could make me stop laughing i would just keep replaying every Joke in my head and id start laughing even more i already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier the comedian was a magician with words the way he put them all together to just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times i laughed and cried over and over again i probably did that for ten minutes straight it was unbelievable making these life long memories with my friends is something that i will never forget i truly know how great i have it in my life people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support i get from my friends and family all my experiences are the things i learn from whether they re good or bad i know that its all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me all the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me they made a point in my day great as well being myself around them is great as well because i know that they re already accepted me into their lives and i don't have to try to be anyone else everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it i really don't even know why they would because what better feeling is there tHan being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while i really don't think that there is any i feel really honoured that i have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life it shouldn't be any other way in my personal oPinion live life to the fullest wHy would You want to live it any other way,40
12316,iTs always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad Most of the time you don't know what to do I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better aS i was sitting at home one sunny afternoon i Got a call from my friends perSON WHen I put the phone to my ear all i couLd hear was a loud crying person WAS NOt saying anything to me not one word even though i repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her person wouldn't Even say a woRd not knowing what to do or say to her anymore i ASKED her to calm down and take deep breaths desperately i wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because i had started to get really worry couple minutes later person started explaining to me what had happen person started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she did not pay attention to what was happening around her i asked her why she was saying that about herself because i knew she was a responsible person finally person screamed that while she was home watching the caps basketball team play basketball her dog caps got run over the dog had actually died i found it very ridiculous and pathetic that person would be crying over her dog i did not want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time even thought that was the way i felt about the whole situation i thought of what the words i needed to say to person but i was confuse actually it was not so much that i was confuse i was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words finally i decided to tell her not to worry about her dog that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale also i told person that if it made her feel any better i would buy her a new puppy after saying that to her there was an awkward silence my hands started to get shaky because i thought person was mad all of the sudden i just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk i felt so relief that i had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me person wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically finally she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again person thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more i was hAppy i made her laugh because she felt better About herself and not worst as i was laughing i Told her that anytime she needed to laugh i was the person she needed to be call anytime Any day and anywhere i would be hapPy to bring a smile to HER FAce and a loud laugh to her mouth person laughED WITh me and thank me one more time for making her laugh from that day on i always like to make people laugh because i know i'm going to make them feel better i sure love it when others make me laugh Too its just an amazing feeling a great feeling that everyone loves and cant Really describe after making my friend person laugh i found out laughter was a key element of life,35

12320,My relationship with laughter Well the first time I came face to face with laughter was when I met my boyfriend for the first time Before I met him I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't stand it anymore But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time wHen that happened for the first time in almost a year i smiled i did not smile until the day i met him that is when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who i am later in the relationship is where laughter came into play i was laughing all the time when i was around him and not upset all the time that is when we started hanging out but it took all of our friends to us to hang out after we stated to hang out we got to know each other better then we did for the beginning when we first met it took until freshmen year for us to start dating that is when i found out i suppose ably dating someone else and not him i did not believe it at first until that guy came up to me and started yelling he came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said caps are caps cheating on me and its over with a guy caps just met then he tried telling me it was over and i told him we were never dating in the first place my friends walked up to me and saw me in tears and asked me whats wrong and tried to find me someone new by the time caps did i was with another guy and i'm happy with him and nOthing can Change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us he is the best thing that has ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when i'm upset or mad he says don't worry everything will be okay i promise so just believe in me laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now so we don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again we have messed up so many time that we don't know what to do anymore if it leaves now i don't know what i'm going to do its apart of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together with out messing up this time around this part of my relationship is the best and it wont change at least i hope that it wont because it would make me go back to living in fear of my step dad i'm glade that i found someone i hope that it does not change because laughter is what comes with him and when i'm around him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when i was crying not even my frieNds and familY now that lAughter is here almost all the time i can't wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window So now that me and him are together and happy and hopefully nothing goes bad between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not my bubbly self when hers not around Six to cAPS of my friends say caps are losing your bubbly self don't let her disappear on cAPS she is there to guide capS DOwn the road caps also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason cAPS I don't is because cAPS can be bossy and cAPS tell me what I can and can't do caPS can't people just understand that this relationship is not going to work if caps keep getting in the middle of it caps all think that my life revolves around them and it does not my relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family it has to do with my boyfriend and me and that is caps i told caps about my relationship with laughter lets just say my relationship with laughter will always be here and nothing will change it not even my parents or his parents we can promise caps that much caps can't this relationship just have a happy ending to it with out anyone or anything trying to get in the middle of it i just wish that there was a world caps could just run away to with out anyone knowinG WHere its at in the world well just to say nothing can make this relationship ever go bad uNLESs we start to fight again with each other i hope that nothing will tear us apart and if it does who knows what will happen,30

12323,Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends mAybe not but maybe you have and couldn't remember Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend pERSON and i Became friends I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends aDmittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time instead we started off as a crier and a helper persoN AND i firsT met in the eighth grade I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my match teacher PERSON perSON told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from lOCATION and was not exactly happy about it she also asked me if i wouldn't mind showing her around The school with another classmate person i agreed and walked into tHE ROOM PERSON WAS IN WHEN I SAW HER THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS HER EYES AS THE TEARS WENT DOWN HER FACE THEN I REALIZED SHE WAS A VERY PRETTY GIRL WHO LIKE PERSON SAID WAS NOT HAPPY I WILL ADMIT I WAS A LITTLE SCARED TO TRY AND SHOW HER AROUND SEEING AS SHE WAS NOT HAPPY AT ALL TO BE HERE BUT ONCE WE GOT STARTED SHE HAD CALMED DOWN IMMENSELY BUT SHE STILL wouldn't even crack a smile at our feEBLE Tempts to mAke jOkes i still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns so i walked dIfferENTLY AND TALKED IN A FUNNY VOICE I EVEN STARTED SAYING RANDOM FUNNY THINGS IN LONG PAUSES EVENTUALLY SHE SMILED SO I KEPT GOING TOWARD THE END I GOT HER AND PERSON TO LAUGH SO HARD WE ALL ALMOST WET OURSELVES BUT AS FUNNY AS IT WAS FOR US IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT THE LAST FUNNY THING WE DID YOU KNOW THE TYPE OF FUNNY THINGS THAT HAPPEN AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER IT WHEN YOU SEE THAT PERSON IT HAPPENED WITH RIGHT WELL TO SAY THE LEAST PERSON AND I HAVE A LOT OF THOSE MOMENTS GRANTED A LOT OF THEM HAPPEN WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT FUN LIKE THIS ONE TIME IN OUR DRAWING AND PAINTING CLASS WE PERSON LOCATION AND CAPS AND I WERE ALL IN PERSON IS LITTLE OFFICE GETTING A PICTURE TO DRAW I HAD BEEN HYPER PRETTY MUCH ALL DAY AND SO HAD CAPS ELSE I RANDOMLY LOOK AROUND THE ROOM AND SEE A REALLY CUTE LOOKING POSTER I HAD NOT NOTICED EVER BEFORE AND WITHOUT realizing it i had said aloud caps that is really cute caps started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground i still had not realized i said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining they finally calmed down long enough to say what id just said and i blushed but started laughing along now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up LAUGHing and they point to something and say it the way i said it that is why i think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together it helps us remember the fun times during the bad times it also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends but the little things matter too every little thing we do together as friends helps us later if we did not do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things or boring things i don't think oUr friendship would last long like when were talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk or maybe when i laugh and i hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom its not just being friends that keeps us together its how we are and who we become with that other person i feel like i become a better person and i believe i help her become one too besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do so as have stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship person and my friendship had not started in of laughter it started in tears and grew to be laughter laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since not only because we had a lot in common to be frank we don't really even have that much in common it is because of the big hilarious moments weave shared not only together but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny i do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy,40

12331,laughter person Laughter has many benefits that make us have might make us have more distance in between two people or maybe make us have differences in between the relationships you have with people But many other people believe and think that laughter is an important part of any relationship with your friends family act Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit to us and how it can also make us have distances from people or how laughter works in between relationships we have with friends Many people think that its really fun to laugh about simple things and that me i can laugh for things that might not seem running to others but to me they might seem extremely funny i won't stop laughing for a while but many other people don't consider laughter as funny as many others i believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express your self on things many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes that the reason why i think its a great idea or thing to do around just have some fun and laugh now talking about relationship in between people do you think that laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how could it help us ways well yes i do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationship we have with people you get to know and others get to know about you and how you are even though many relationships that we have with our friends family or with new people we meet i believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them laughter expresses how that person is and whether they are fun people to be around laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humour just a little or does not have any humour at all when people don't have that much humour they Really don't understand and get the funny parts from jokes or anything i also think that laughter is really important to any type of relationship you have with anybody because that makes you know that person a lot Better but other people consider laughter being a reason that distances two people from each other i don't consider laughter being a reason for to people to have distances in between the reasons why i think and say this is because their are many people that laugh a lot almost crying and they don't have distances in between other people or anything they might get more friends or more people to talk to them because other people as well might see how that person is and they might see that the person is really fun to be around with i know this because i laugh a lot and that has not happened to me that why i don't consider and don't believe that laughter is being the reason to have distances in between people relationship in my opinion i consider laughter a very important part of who we are the way we think and also the things we like to do what i mean by this is that you can have some humour but you don't actually express the way you are thinkIng about what other do or if something is super silly and theirs a new kid at school and you or someone else says something you might probably think that its funny but you might just not want to laugh at that moment because you month a little to shy or simply because you might not know that person as well and maybe the other person won't have enough confidence to laugh with you for whatever silly thing someone just said although many people still should laugh whenever they want sometimes if you laugh a lot you might be the happiest and funniest person anywhere or whenever somebody is sad you might as well be the only person their who can make her him laugh and happy in addition these were some of the reasons why i think that laughter is great for you that way people will get to know you better these were a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit how it can distance people,31

12333,cAPS fills the air around us with happiness and joy caPS brings warm memory is of loved ones that are close to us and adds a splash of hope to those who need caps laughter is the key to solving lifers problems caps is a way of adding something special into our life and comes from many different areas of life laughter could come from a pitiful joke that someone could have told you caps could be brought up by a show and caps could also come from the joy we get when a near loved one has returning home from a long journey imagine seeing something comical like a person falling down or crashing into a pole the moment right when that happens you hear your self laughing as hard as you can that you practically cant breath and the person standing right next to you is joining in on the laugh although caps might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you caps is how friendships are brought up and made just by one little thing that made you both laugh and have a connection with each other can trigger a brand new friendship between to people that could either last a minute or can last a life time in my case caps is how i met one of my closest friend ever we had seen a student from our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the flag pole and replace the organization state flag with his own personal home made flag he got the caps off of a show as he was heading up the pole almost half way their he must have gotten scared because minutes later he started yelling for help a minute later the faculty members finally heard his cross and yells and tried to get him down from ware he was caps took them almost half an hour to get him down caps was the moment ware i had made one of the greatest friendship have ever had in my life many friendships are made in class and with the people you go to work with but a great friendship is brought up by a simple laugh two people share with each other god laughs last caps is the name of person son of caps and person in caps story person the caps of person claimed that she was surprised when she was blessed with her only child and that people would laugh and be surprised the same way she was when they hear the news being surprised or shocked can also bring some one to laugh at what either happened in their surroundings or what they did them self is i remembered a time ware i laughed at something that took me by surprise caps was when my caps lost the keys to the house inside the car we looked for them every ware but had no luck finding them after an hour had pass we called my dad so he would bring the other key to the house after we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get their but as soon as my father parked in the driveway my caps found the key that she lost inside her pocket caps was a typical cartoon moment when we heard the news we all just started laughing at what has just happen we were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened as you can see being surprise can also bring a smile and a laugh onto someones face picture yourself staring into the eyes of some one close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out the slightest bit of a giggle or a smile and then find yourself laughing nonstop for no reason that is basically an every day thing for me and my sister my sister and i can't stare at each other for even a minute we eventually start laughing the first five seconds and end up lAUGHing a hole hour without stop but as soon as we stop laughing we notes that we were laughing for no apparent reason which would make us laugh for another hour more that the kind of laughter that two people that are so close to each other get the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh but you end up laughing for no reason at all caps shows the connection two people have with each other the type ware you know what the other person is thinking laughter can come from old memory is of family gatherings for the holidays friendships we made when we were in school memory is of our childhood and how thing we thought then were in style and cool are know thing we look back into and laugh at by being a little surprise and can also be the fact that WE know someone by heart,32
12334,lAughter laugh everyday i feel a lot of different emotions when i am laughing soMe of the emotions are happiness sadness and pain I use laughter to let my emotions be seen when i laugh i usually feel happy after wards in less I am crying because I am hurt When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i did not have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy when i am angry the only way i can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if i am reminiscing of fun times in had it makes me happy when i laugh and brightens my day when i am anger i also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it because i don't want them to know they hurt me when i am happy all i do is smile and laugh laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh my friends and i can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing my friends and i can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh have fun and be in a good mood and that makes me pretty happy some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends all those things i was just talking about come into my mind when i think of laughter i think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy,30

12336,Laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others It lightens the mood of any situation and can really lift my sprits when I'm having a bad day It is often the ice breaker when I meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends I already have on the first day of school freshman year i meT a girl named locatION We were in writing class and there was a boy named cAPS sitting between us caPS and I were talking about our schedules and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomfortable I looked up and saw that lOCATION had heard what he had said and had a look on her face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and close to laughing i smiled at her and mouthed the word awkward when caPS Turned away This was her cue that it was okay to laugh and she did so subtly i did not know that this first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly after the first week of schedules being changed and students being shuffled around we found out that we had every single one of our classes together except caps we probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done and i'm not exactly sure how we managed to pass all our classes spending so much time together it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill up a dictionary nearly any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can send us into a fit of laughter sometimes we don't have to say anything at alL i'll just look at her and we'll burst out laughing because of this our friends often question our sanity when we start laughing they'll look at each other and then at us for a clue as to why or ask if we are okay they don't understand us the way we understand each other people always get our names mixed up even though we look nothing alike our names done even rhyme or start with the same letter but i can't really blame them were so much alike from the activities we participate in to the way we think we could almost be the same person she makes me laugh every single day and sheds one of my best friends caps is another one of my friends who is constantly making me crack up whenever i'm with her i'm always terrified of peeing in my pants sheds not as close to me as location is but weave gotten to be such better friends this year we have a lot of classes together this year and that is probably why weave gotten closer were always doing stupid stuff together and laughing about it the whole time for example SHE and i like to laugh obnoxiously loud and exaggerate our has when someone tells a really lame or cheesy joke our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes so when WERE IN HIS CLASS WE SIT TOGETHER ANTICIPATING ONE OF HIS JOKES SO THAT WE CAN LAUGH WE ALSO LIKE TO CHEW OUR GUM WITH OUR MOUTHS OPEN IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CHEWING NOISE LOUDER I OFTEN LAUGH SO HARD THAT I CAN't even chew i know i'll have a good day if i'm with caps shE can make me laugh in a way a lot of my other friends can't it comes deep from within to the point where you can't even breathe and tears and running down your face it makes your entire face is sore Even your eyes from being scrunched up for so long sheds such a fun person to be around and i'm glad to have her as one of my friends laughing is a very important part in the relationships i have with other people if my friends couldn't make me laugh our friendship would be so mUch more boring nothing would be fun if i never laughed id never be happy and that is not a life i'm willing to try life is hard its not easy and its not always going to be smiles and smooth sailing there is going to be sadness and rough waters but no matter how tough this life month get i know i'll have friends like location and caps there to share a laUgh,45

12345,I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in lOCATION We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them aFter first half we scored nuMB goals so we won numB To numb THe reAson that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really was not The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it,29
12346,lAughter is something that is there when you are happy Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood it makes us smile Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh For example someone trips over your backpack and cAPS fall capS THeir face You can't help it but laugh Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping but then you start remembering how caPS fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble lAughter is a big part of your life that their is not at least a time of day that you don't laugh everybody in my family is fun and caps always make me laugh their is not a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say awkward silence we are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call good times i will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family and how embarrassment is involved it is a beautiful sunny day caps date today was a big day for me organization it was the day i was going to have my caps party i woke up took a shower went to my momus organization and sat down caps a chair to have my hair done i was wearing my person pyjamas with a black shirt that said caps caps i got my hair done did my make up put my dress caps went outside to take pictures and got caps the limousine so i could go to church after i went to church i took pictures with my family and then went to caps to take pictures at the organization building after we got back from caps i went to the organization at caps and got ready for my waltz i did my first waltz with my court of honor six guys and six girls and my partner after the waltz i danced the second waltz with my dad when i was done dancing with my dad i got ready for the surprise dance i started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part i was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name caps ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys who is my uncle ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong the guys were supposed to spell organization with two guys wearing black caps each end but caps ended up spelling caps one of the other guys saw the mistake right away so he moved to the left and since my uncle did not move to the left either caps ended up spelling caps i'm am not going to lie i saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way but i could of stopped that from happening but i did not because i couldn't but at the end it was funny Everybody in there started laughing AND i got so embarrassed but when i was walking off the Dance floor i started laughing now that we think about it that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family i guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens laughter is something that is there when you are happy laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood it makes us smile but laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment laughter is always with us it does not matter if we mean to or not but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh laughter is always with me when i'm with my family laughter is with me because my family is fun crazy and cool no matter how sad we are it does not matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person we enD up remembering the fun we had together that we start laughing really hard laughter is there when we are happy but it is also there when iT is the best day of your life laughter is a moment of haPpiness,36

12348,Has there ever been a person that you know that just made you laugh like no one else could oR had a moment or a daTE When you laughed as if there was no tomorrow Laughter is something that everyone can relate to no matter the age or the personality It fills you with warm feeling that spills out like a waterfall tHere is not always a reason for the things that people do there is always mystery the same thing applies to laughter sometimes you are just so happy that it all builds up inside and has to be let out during the date of my sixth going on seventh grade year my friend person and i were nearly inseparable person was the first friend that i had made upon moving from location organization in the beginning of my sixth grade year but in a short amount of time we became best friends on date we were at my house by ourselves and we wanted to do something fun and creative so we decided to make a fort out of sheets and furniture we took chairs and the ends of some couches and date tables and tied sheets and blankets from them falling over ourselves and not paying attention to anything else we made a plane of fabric about three or four feet above the ground tall enough to crawl under and sit down we then took a tack in the wall and pinned a sheet to hang over the flat sheet as our walls we then filled the make shift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on by the date of our adventure the living room was a mess and the furniture was all over the place it was as if a tornado had run through the house even though it was not the biggest or best fort we had built but we did not care we had a blast building it i remember sitting in the fort and talking to her about anything that came up we talked about school people and just life in general we made jokes like we love to do and just fed off of each others good feelings and energy i was on cloud nine and no one was about to bring me down that date i laughed like there was nothing wrong in the world i was carefree and was not afraid to show it we were both laughing almost constantly to the point of tears even though when i look back now some of the things that we laughed about were not all that funny it was one of those days with the laughs that fill you up with so much energy and joy that you can't even contain yourself and it is so contagious that others can't help but join you we let ourselves out in cries of joy and cACKLES i had never laughed SO HARD in MY LIFE AND i never wanted it to stop it was not necessarily because of something funny that person had done or said but i was just so happy that everyThing seemed worthy of laughing about and every time i started to laugh she couldn't help but join me and that would just set us off laughing harder by the date we were both emotionally drained person ended up staying the night because we never wanted the date to leave but eventually every date ends every morning is a new beginning and every night an date to something but when you close your eyes to sleep after a long date of laughing you feel full not of happiness but of life and that feeling is not something that is easily taken away so live and laugh like today is the last date and never forget the memories that you created in the times befOre,40

12356,Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness It is to become amused or derisive Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh It is never something we should take for granted tHrough many relationships no matter what kind I believe laughter takes up at least pERCENT of your relationship its to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening there are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter i'm sure you can even think of one in my views of this world and our society today i believe laughter is what makes up our human spirit its to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh i have asked myself this same question over and over for me making people laugh is letting them know i care and to also think I'm funny as well we even do it just the fAct of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny hilarious or just a good person to talk to sometimes we can go to the extremes of being to funny and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way i remember in the eighth grade i was thirteen years old i was really shy and did not have much friends one day in class some of thE popular kids actually came over and started talking to me i was caps excited And nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me of course they were laughing and making jokes not caring what anyone else was saying then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything when she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time because some of the things she was saying were true that is were i messed up i started talking about all the other dumb things she did just to make everybody else laugh as i was sitting there all i felt was guilt and disappointment in myself i couldn't believe i was sitting there talking about my best friend just to try and make myself popular later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why i would do that to her i told her i was sorry and that i only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids we did not talk for almost two weeks caps i tried to do everything in mY OWN POSSIBLE WAY TO GET MY BEST FRIEND BACK IT DID TAKE ME AWHILE BUT SHE FINALLY CAME AROUND AND FORGave me it was a good life lesson for me knowing laughter month not always be a good thing now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day we both together can share a laugh in conclusion you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down i have experienced these things as well in my life time laughter has made me stronger and to be a better person even if it means turning down popular kids caps you don't hurt those closEst to you caps go out and make somebody laugh today,34
12357,Laughter is very important in my life I laugh everyday People wouldn't be the same without laughter and the world wouldn't be the same tWo days ago my capS CLass went to the computer lab to type our caps WRITing test Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay i was annoyed because i already had passed the essay and i Did not want to take it again but i had to once i got to the computer lab i sat in my chair and logged into my account after a few minutes my computer finally loaded and i could log into caps once i got there i logged in and my computer froze i had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen i laughed at them for their computer being frozen and they laughed at me because mine was frozen after a few minutes my account finally logged in and i selected to take the essay after my computer being frozen for a few minutes i got an error message and it logged me out of caps this had also happened to month of the other students and i laughed because of my my classmates computer was still frozen and the screen was white i logged back in and it froze for a while i tried logging in again but kept getting different errors i noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages or their computers were still frozen after a few attempts my test finally loaded and i could begin the test after debating for a moment my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test i then logged off and logged back into caps my computer started to log me in but then it froze and logged me out of caps this had also happened to many of the other students taking the test after trying to log in the farthest i could reach was waiting for my caps to approve me my caps said that he had approved me several times but nothing had worked after a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test i logged off of my account and got back on at this time i was laughing because it had worked before but i was not able to get back to my test by now over half the period had gone by no one not even the caps knew what was going on but very few people had started their test after a few more tries and nothing being able to work the class was almost over my caps told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test when i walked into the room i thought it was going to a very boring period i was wrong in a good way the class was not boring and i spent much of it laughing although i did not get my essay done it was a good class this was a good experience and i'm sure i will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time,35
12358,Laughter is something everyone needs in their life wE all need some humour and even sometimes we need to laugh at ourselves yOu need a laugh a smile and a sense of humour to live life to its fullest when people take things other have said differently or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh and they take it the wrong way people told me you need a sense of humour you know caps i feel bad for taking it too seriously back my sophomore year i was going through a rough time with friends and family becoming more and more apart from each other i don't even remeMber laughing or smiling last year lets just say through the first four to five months of sophomore year it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke once sophomore year was coming to a close i realized there was more to life caps moping around in my own self pity it was getting close to date vacation and i know i wanted to make date and my junior year my year and that no one would ruin it for me after from being all sad and not having any fun and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me i know i needed to hang out with him a lot more when my dad and i hung out we had more laughs caps i couldn't even remember having it was a really good memory to have especially with my dad my self esteem was getting a lot better caps it use to be i was really happy with myself that i only tried once and now i had a better relationship with my dad too so far life was going great for me i realized that i was more happy when i recognized myself and told people the real truth about me i have to say i never smiled nor laughed as much as i did in a while the truth about me was that i was diagnosed with gender identity disorder i did not go through any therapy i just knew it was the real me and it was probably why i was so sad my sophomore year when i discovered myself i knew there was a lot More to life caps getting a better reputation i was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend or even get to know me A LOt mOre it was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions aBout who i wanted to be called and what a trans gender was i felt wanted interesting secure and most of all happy i know i was going to geT more harassment down the road frOm coming out i got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and i laughed at all of them wHo sent me hate mail calls and text messages it was really worth the laugh because i knew what i was talking about and they did not know a thing about transgenders or gender identity disorder hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off i survived through a hot date and now it was time for school i was really excited for it to start and even more excited for the sports ahead of me i knew i was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it when it was around my birthday like a month into the school year i realized i needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time not that i was not smiling or laughing i just know i needed it more in my life there was a girl that started talking to me on caps book she was really cute her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big my cheeks would end up burning her name was person and that also fit her everything was just so great about her we ended up talking on the phone at twelve in the time on my birthday by far that was the best night i had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me person and i hung out that weekend at caps caps in location when we headed up there her friend person was singing to the songs by caps while person mocked her squeaky voice i never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain so you see having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have you even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling especially when they make your heart melt and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you even just to make yOur caps light up with a smile,30
12359,iN a relationship you should be able to trust in each other confide in each other talk with each other cry with each other and most importantly laugh with each other Many people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships and i can definitely agree with that statement thE relationship in my life that i Totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend and boyfriend persoN He can always make me laugh even on my worst days he can find a smile and a little giggle I constantly thank cAPS for putting him in my life the First thing that i reAlly noticed about persoN when I started to get to know him better is that he can always make me laugh Whether he is making totally weird faces at me or tickling me until I can barely breath he always knows how to get me laughing wHen i am balling my eyes out to him even then he can get me to giggle Just tIME i Had had a terrible day at school and within a few minutes of me crying to him he had cheered me up and got me to laugh In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a face and start laughing there is something about those blue eyes and that dorky smile that will always make me laugh our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning when we play caps or he plays and i fail at attempting to play we always laugh at how bad i am at it or when i finally do get an awesome kill that just works out don't it is one of our inside jokes obviously its not all that funny but we have fun competing at who can say it the most in one day the rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets the point as if we actually keep score buT that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use when evEr there is a CAMEra around person likes to Make funny faces which will always get me laughing then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make when one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too they do say laughter is contagious to be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at your self one time person his little sisters person and person and i were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short i kneed myself in the forehead person was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force and he just got silent until i started cracking up then he made sure i was okay we were laughing so hard we cried and i had a big red circle on my forehead not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too but i just laughed it off another time we were goofing around on the hard wood floor at his house and i pushed him to the ground his whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red but he just laughed it off whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off even when things get rough our you disagree on something It is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other just because person and i are best friends does not mean we agree on everything we actually disagree about a lot of things most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger at times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh obviously i have reason too agree with the statement laughter is the shortest distance between two people because i have that connection in the best way possible i am so thankful to have person in my life his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place so between caps over a text message cracking up at weird things we do or Just watching a movie we are always laughing at EACH Other or with each other as we both would put it were freaking soul mates,44

12366,capS A do you know where my purse is i Wonder where it is i nEed to put my license in my wallet I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes A sigh of relief came over me I was glad I found it before something happened I woke up dATE timE and figured it would be just another day I had plans to go to a basketball game after school It was the biggest game of the season we were playing our rivals the caPS Caps The day was going by slow though I couldn't wait until it was over Finally the bell rang school was over I drove home a little disappointed i was not sure if my friends were going to the game with me if they did not go i probably wouldn't either i was determined though i texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun i picked up my friend person first then person this is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever the organization where the game was being held was about twenty minutes away i had to stop and get gas before we left we went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car when it was time to leave my car decided not to start i have an old car and it does not start all the time it just sits there for a while until it wants to start there were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us we just started laughing it was really embarrassing the attendant asked us if we needed something else and i said no my car just was not starting i tried turning it on again but it just kept dining out of all the other days my car decided not to start today then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car i got so embarrassed and starting laughing again i always laugh when i get nervous i told them to let me try turning on my car once more i prayed my car would turn on this time it did i was so relieved and embarrassed i left as soon as i could twenty minutes later we were in organization in front of the school and just my luck again no parking spots we drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance then we gathered our things and walked to the game it had not started yet but it was about to i had a feeling it would be a really close game soon the game began and just how i figured the game kept going back and forth we got a point they got a point it was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game they kept shouting at players shouting at the referee and just being annoying the game was good but in the end the caps caps won by caps points it was a little disappointing but the organization did have a good team after the game we were going to eat at organization we left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic i was driving down this road i thought i new but then i realized i did not recognize it at all person told me to keep going she new where we were i stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by caps i got onto one of the main roads and headed to organization the road i was on had a million stop lights though and i was stopping every numb minutes then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me i waited for him to cross even though he was not even on a crosswalk i kept going no worries on my mind music blasting when suddenly rainbow lights behind me this day couldn't get any Worse i pulled over and wAited for the caps to come up to my window he asked for my license and registration i got my purse and looked in my wallet my heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago i started to panic and laughter filled the air my nerves got to me i couldn't help it i looked everywhere finally he asked if i had my school id i went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath he went back to his car leaving me bursting with laughter he came back and told me my insurance was expired another thing that added to my day i was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance i think i got it because i was laughing and he thought i was taking it as a joke you cant control nerves though or at least i can't,43
12367,Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion It can break the ice in an award situation or help you become closer to someone some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and that laughter is the best medicine i believe that both of those statements are true personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations through my numb years of life one time in particular that i remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when i was camping with a few of my friends it was three years ago in the middle of date and we were all sleeping outside under the stars we had all been talking about pretty serious stuff family and friend probLems and just sharing our hardships in general with each other i did not really have much to complain about i had a pretty average family that i loved along with good Friends however that evening i was learning some interesting but disturbing information aboUT my friends home liFe she started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics i could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her the mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious emotional conversation she continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends becauSe we always have a good time after she toLd me all of this we laid in silence for a while neither of us were asleep but i had no idea what to say i mean how could anything i say make that situation better or help her to feel better while we had been having this conversation our other friend haD run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom we heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark all of a sudden she knew where we were she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer That is a memory that I will never forget it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close Similar experiences have occurred throughout my whole life Laughter is a common ground where all people can relate to one another maYbe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimately laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else aLl of your problems disappear,36

12371,iT was some day in daTE I waS on my way to school my frIend person was walking with me because we both lived on the same street He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out I slipped a few times but never fell We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over We got to school and he started telling everyone about it I joined in It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble aFter first period i found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun my friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it the bell rang for second period to start and i hEaded to my class It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere oNce i got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me wE boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there He must have done it about every nUMB minutes it was pretty annoying The bus driver was playing country music too I don't really mind country music but that day I did not really want to listen to it i went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it was not there i had left it at my house when i was rushing to get to school we finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus i thought he was just talking smack and i asked the bus driver if he was serious the bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we did not get the seats wet again i thought it was a bunch of bull we met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for while walking around the ponds i started to slide on the ground i grabbed onto my friend so i wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over everyone sTarted laughing as well as myself my friend did not think it was too funny at first but once he got up he started laughing and joked about how i couldn't stand up right on our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds i thought it would be pretty fun if i did not slip around the whole time we unloaded the bus again and headed into the school i found out the little puddle i had found earlier had not dried up i got a running start and slid across it i did not fall over this time the bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day which unfortunately for me was caps i got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing he told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class i lucked ouT big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats i got done with caps and the bell rang to tell us school was over i got dressed into My normal clothes and headed home my friend person was waiting outside for me we started heading home and i slide around with every step i took the sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice i looked over at location and laughed he laughed too the whole way home i was skating on ice it was a really fun day except right when I got home i fell on the deck because the step was icy,38

12377,Laughter plays an important role in relationships caps also supports enjoyment and can be a pursuit of happiness whenever i am laughing its either because i am really enjoying myself or in just having a great time many people don't have a very good sense of humour and DONE laugh at things that are funny whenever i watch a funny movies that i like i sit down and wait for the very funny parts but done get me wrong remember not to laugh to hard because you might wet you re pants by accident or who knows if you laugh hard enough you might even pull a who tammy and trust me that does not look pretty and then you will be embarrassed in front of everybody my favourite comedian is adam handler because he is very funny and has a good sense of humour he knows how to keep a person laughing and interested in his comedy shows and movies when he made the big daddy movie caps was pretty good not to funny but caps was good my second favourite comedian is person because he is funnier that adam handler by a oil bit but not quit as good though he also stars on a to show called wild in out that show really makes me almost cough out my lungs especially when they bust out with you re mama jokes caps keeps you laughing and keeps the blood pumping thru you re body so we all pretty much under stand what laughing is but most people done really seem to laugh at things that are funny i cant quit understand caps but my guess is that they done have a good sene of humour but some people seem to laugh at thing that done even make sense i quit done understand that either but i guess its better to laugh than to not laugh at all some really good comedy movies that i can mention out right off the the bat that will keep you tuned and laughing thru more than half off the movies are grandmas boy happy gilmore done be a menace to south central while sizing my juice also zombie land caps is a heck of a good movie i done know its not just about making a funny movie just to make tHe audience laugh caps is the way they make caps and how they act and how good the background story to the comedy movies is gonna be that what i pay aten ion to when ever i sit down and inspect what makes the movie funny also if i cant understand a funny movie i see caps again and again till i understand what is so hall rouse about caps that pretty much covers the basics on laughter there are is you re basic information and what you need to know about caps and how to enjoy caps and use caps wisely cause remember done caught to hard because you done want to end up pulling a who tammy in front off every one that around thank you for reading my test,32
12378,lAughter is the cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebodies pain laUghter can mend a friendship to make two strangers become the best of friends A person can ask anybody on the street of how much laughter is important in life and they would say that laughter is very important iTs like love everyone needs a little of it in their life and like laughter it helps a person grow and become an adult a person can use laughter to help them with anything like getting a job or trying to get the girl or just having a good time and making new friends its one of the main elements of life that make a person how they are and what they do in the date i was introduced to a girl named date by my cousin person she started talking to me and i was shy because she was a girl and i was not used to talking to girls i cracked a joke and that made her and i laugh together and that was the first icebreaker to making a new friend the days went by and we were text messaging each other each day over the phone making jokes about how our day was and making jokes about each other eventually we started talking to each other over the phone teens these days usually don't use the phone to call people and that makes emotions hard to understand because talking over text hides emotions from one another date called me and we would talk to each other until late in the time to where we would both fall asleep and leave the phone on and again we would always be making jokes about everything making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school making her happy was what i needed to do and one of the ways to make her happy was to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentlemen because i was raised that way date formal was coming near and i was in need of a date date was my best option for a date since i was getting close to her and i was starting to get attached to her when i had the chance i asked her to be my date for the date formal which would be one of the most special nights of my freshmen year the day of the formal came and we danced the time away and of course i had to make a few jokes about other things which made everyone laugh and have a good time near tHe end of the dance i asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted she said i was funnY and niCE And cute which was good we had a fun TIME because good humOUR ANd fUn kept the time alive the nexT date formal the same thing happened with a different girl except that Laughter was an important key and that made the time so much fun that time was one of the best nights of my life that i had ever had because we were laughing and having the best time ever laughter is an important key in my life i would have never gotten the girl or have had the best time of my life if laughter was never involved laughter makes everything better and i use it in my everyday life because everybody needs to have a good laugh if they are in a bad mood without laughter my life would be dull and have no colour that would make me who i am today its one of the many keys of life that everyone needs to be happy and without it you would be less happy then you are right now a small child could live his whole childhood without laughter or any other important element in his life and he could end up being a mean and cruel person who does not understand good values and humour everybody needs personality and colour in their life and with out it everything id grey life is like a colouring book and without someone or something to colour them in with its just useless,37
12379,I have had many great times with my grandpa He is a very funny and loving man wHen my cousin my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the ORGANIZATION The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground caPS campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first tIME Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food The next tIME on the way out we saw a sign that read caution racoon problem capS MAde us laugh all the way to locatION WHICh is a small town on the ORGANIZATION onCe in locATION WE stopped for gas and more food to last through the time While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny A young blond woman came out to help us and she was not the smartest person i have met she charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the neArest grocery store was well as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly dumb blonde while the woman was standing right there she didst say a word and my grandpa drove off wIth me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath my grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde he was so oblivious to the situation that he did not notice what came out of his mouth at the time what even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened the next time we stayed at a different campground with no racoons still the time was filled with laughter we were roasting marshmallows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmallow on his stick he wasted about six marshmallow before he even got one that he could eat and every time he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny we laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt the best part was the at my grandpa did not think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something in the tent that time we were so tired everything seemed funny to us we laughed at each other until two in the time that when everything went silent and we couldn't last any longer we were all asleep within secOnds my cousin and i have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other my grandpa is a great man and i look up to him for many things in my life he has always keep me laughing and i try to do the same for him he and i believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with keep laughing and have a fun in all you do,40
12380,laUghter I believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people When things between you and a loved one get fuzzy making them laugh will always help break the ice When I get angry with my boyfriend he knows that in order for me to be happy he must make me smile laugh That is exactly what he does The very first time he made me angry he did not know what to do it was date caps and i had just started dating i remember he asked me if i was hungry and i said no i'm not hungry so he continued to ask since we had onLy been DATIng FOR a shorT period of time he really did not know much about me so he did not know that i am a type of girl that gets annoyed easily and i have a really low temper he continued to ask me if i was hungry thirsty bored or tired but he did not realize that at this point i was really annoyed an hour and a half passed by and he was still asking i was going crazy i did not want to tell him how i felt because i knew i was going to make him feel bad but i thought to myself and said no he has to know because its going to be worst if later on in the relationship he has to find out what i like and don't like on his own rather that me telling him i went on and told him every single little detail about me good and bad at first he just listened but towArds the end he exploded and told me that why was not i just straight up with him from the beginning that made me really upset i was trying to be honest with him before anything worse happened but i guess not i stayed quiet for the longest time and he kept askinG me whats wrong tell me what i did wrong so i told him that it really made me upset how he flipped out on me for no reason really all i was trying to do was save us from a larger argument he looked at me and told me that i did do something wrong he said that we had already been together for two months and it took me that Long to show him my true colours i kind of undersTOOD WHERE HE WAS COMING FROM BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DID NOT AGREE BECAUSE BY THAT POINT HE SHOULD have already known i Mean it does not take thaT long to know A person especially if its your girlfriend in the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other he busted out saying ouch charlie you bit me in a caps accent that just made me loose it i laughed for days after that and completely forgot about thee over whelming discussion we had the point being here is that laughter is the tool to breaking the ice when thiNgs get tough and it does not necessarily have to be a loved one it can even be a complete stranger if the person is shy making them laugh will help construct a great friendship with them you can make anybody is day go great with just a little grin that you put on their face a simple hello or hey can even make them smile i believe that a person that smiles often lives longer this month not be true but in my little world it is i am all about smiling all about making people laugh honestly i hate seeing people walk around with angry faces like if they have no friends when all they really want is someone to make them smile and that would be me in conclusion if it was not for laughter what relationship would still be standing at this point none because if your always arguing and always wining and never laughing then how do you expect your relationship to last like i said laughter is the shortest distance bEtween two peoplE,35
12381,Angelina cAPS capS A year ago some time in the date I was at my best friend pERSON is house for a sleepover after her caps party we were exhausted from swimming at her caps is pool and taking her dog for a walk not to mention the partying and we would have been asleep if it were not for the family sized bag of caps and six pack of organization wed consumed not an hour before at around three in the time our childish minds searching for something to do we decided it was a good idea to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish in hopes of them glowing in the dark when held to the black light on her windowsill i was the first one daring enough to touch my tongue to the brush and boy did it hurt the acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds the next day was date and after hanging out at location is house for the afternoon we came to my house for another sleepover which is what we did and sometimes still do every time we are together that night this time around two in the time we grew hungry again and came downstairs to get a snack before retreating back to my room and person playing on my computer while i used her phone to text my former crush person got jars or ice water i still don't know why she uses jars instead of cups interrupted my spinning around the kitchen floor with my new socks and we had a random instantaneous ice chugging contest after ten seconds of silence i glanced over my jar at lOCATion who wAs not even half done with her water there on her chin was a speck a dot a glob of blue nail polish i attempted a gasp to give me enough air to start laughing at her but instead of air coming into my windpipe and ice cube made its way in choking laughing falling on the floor laughing nail polish picking and more laughing we stood in the middle of the kitchen with nothing to actually laugh at that was that funny person dropped her jar and it shattered on the floor sending shards of glass and water across the kitchen but that is okay we were having fun and guess what we fell asleep on the kitchen floor not ten minutes later i suppose we were more tired then we thought we did clean up the glass though some people say laughing is the best medicine a doctor can use that it can cure any disease that it can brighten anyone is day dentists apprentices use laughing gas that makes people loopy and smile a lot when they do operations on your teeth and it does not hurt as much until the day after but that is because you just had a tooth pulled today person and i are still best friends sure we get in fights but they end within a week or two the longest fight we were ever in lasted a month and a half and it was a misunderstood rumour another friend of mine had started and ended by us both laughing caps how stupid whatever happened really was within the five or six years of person and i being fRIENds we realized laughing is healthy and good for you both physically and emotionally to relieve stress so every time we see each other we laugh as much as possible inside jokes popping up from something said that was totally unrelated a funny looking person walking down the side of the road or just our own minds saying its time to be happy again it all triggers laughter sometimes it hurts but we cANT help laughing harder because Its fun,40

12388,caPS Is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in therEfore caps makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations caPS is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each others company My story is an example of daughters connection between people and the strength of the bond caPS Forms pictUre the scene caps wAS Date on THE north side of caps hood BELOw tHe infamous snow dome Standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he could not continue further pAtiently standing beside him was his father a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in lOCATION and locATION THe bOy was tired he could not put one foot in front of the other his musCles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony the date sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground caPS was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat fAtigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs His brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting on foot in front of the other He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often tHe boys father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going with no avail He tried another tack he began to tell the boy stories perhaps in hope that capS would take the boys mind of the excruciating pain And to the relief of all concerned caPS proved effective What was most interesting about the whole event is cAPS was not the content of the stories that helped capS WAs the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me iN the presence of my fathers humour I found the strength to keep going capS was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed My arms and leg which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead lightened considerably The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left tHe dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels were silenced This was all due to someones thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone I believe laughter to be the aesthetic of nature the emotional element that keeps the world sane caPS was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father i had no shortage of traits to choose from He had a indomitable work ethic was a great teacher and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy bUt what i respected most about him was that we were similar in our humour wE laughed at the same things and found hilarity at each others comments caps FORged a strong bond between us one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day Whenever I am morose he always manages to find away to bring a smile to my face and I found that I to had the same ability tO my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship respect and love You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter caPS is the drug that descends from the heavens a drug that runs through the bloodstream of society in the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring lauGhter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also began to laugh Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spreads throughout both of your faces as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at That connective force is a result of the power of laughter,50
12389,lAughing smirking giggling capS chuckling these all have to do with one subject caPS That is laughing Laughter is everywhere you hear it in libraries parks at home behind your back caPS It can be a great thing or a horrible thing in ORGANIZATION caPS even with family cAPS friends Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them helped them out cheered them up or even just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever iT was the start of a brand new ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION caPS I had just moved from lOCATION I was a seventh grader about to start at ORGANIZATION in loCATION Caps WAS not a real big fan of hanging out with people so i stayed to myself most of the weeks eating lunch in the guidance enter trying to figure out where books where without talking to anybody my schedule was good i had choir art drama you know all the stuff i like art caps drama were a blast but when it came to choir caps singing my social level went down i love to sing but never did it in front of people then one day i was walking to choir caps i tripped caps fell my papers falling with me my organization work was all over the hall match at one end science at the other but out of all the kids in the hallway only one laughed she walked by caps say i did a great job but something triggered her to come back she helped me pick up all my match homework caps picked up my schedule caps saw that she too had choir this period her name was person she told me caps i told her my name caps we walked together we sat next to each other caps i sang with her ours voices in harmony we talked in between periods at lunch on the bus ride home we became great friends caps the principal thought so too caps he went ahead caps gave us classes together we were friends caps we still are friends till this day but the sad thing is is that she moved at the near end of eighth grade year but she was the only friend i had for a little while caps i always give her a call every now caps then sometimes we can talk for hours laughing caps talking about how we are doing caps when we are going to see each other again she has been my best friend for at least two years now caps it all happened by a slip of a foot that falling of papers caps one little laugh from an amazing person laughing has got me so far in life caps at organization every now caps then when i see someone all alone wanting a friend i go caps talk to them caps even laugh with them one little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen even if you don't think so it does some say laughter is the shortest distance between two people caps i believe who ever said that because it happened to me,40

12391,Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are Some people think that you mONTH be one person who can be stuck up or a funny person who can really be stuck up but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives CAPS are blue roses are red your always in my head i want you in my bed that is sUppose to be a love poem when your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love if your partner is never open about anything you probably don't have a greaT relationship see if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it your relationship involves love and laughter friendship is another great relationship for laughter for example my friend and i were invited to a birthday party she had lots of fun games and lots of food my friend that went with me to the party her name is person it was getting late and we were tired we were not doing anything this was probably around numb in the time see us for some reason do love to sleep but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just did not want the night to end at all we al sat and played there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching caps a then out of random i started to laugh at location and till this day i don't know why i was lAughing at her all of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me then i was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing i was almost to the point where i couldn't breathe no more so i got up walk my self to the bathroom but i could still hear caps laughter in the room which was still making me laugh since that night person and i got a lot closer iN OUr FrieNdship laughter is a lot in life it might MAke you feel like your dying sometimes but that feeling is worth iT,37
12392,As we all know water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it wed pretty much die well its also quit similar with laughter i once heard my night school teacher say caps is percent attitude i thought about it for a a moment and realized its quit true no one can really go throughout the hole day without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason will soon end up smiling who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever have been going out with my boyfriend location for about seven months already we don't get to see each oTher as much as id like to we try to spend the weekends together as much as we can but there is been times when its every other weekend since him and i have quit a few things in common like our relatives knowing each other before dating places we go for entertainment food likes and dislikes we rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time together or what were doing even though its been about seven months since weave been dating it feels like weave known each other way before we became friends once when i was over at location is house celebrating person is birthday organization is youngest sister we all who where there were celebrating her birthday with pinatas cake and all she wanted witch where toys too we where all having a good time but the kids were not so much it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours beforE the kids could even mention anything about THE pinatAS WE Had already goTten most of what was need to set up the pinatas as they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others could get to hit the pinata person go to hit the pinata before all the others since it was her birthday then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata as they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs it was not the best but we all tried we even made jokes of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing as time passed it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata most of us were kind of shy but before i notice a numb year old went up to hit the pinata right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up they were actions to get the candy out after her term was over she was suppose to call out on someone i thought she would end up calling me since she keep looking towards me i was already blushing good thing she didst she ended up calling out on my boyfriend he of course got up and graded the stick to hit the pinata once he got there the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones shouldn't like him anYmore since he is one of those persons who is love caps everyone he heard me up to go with him without him saying that ii don't think i would of done it right there were we where teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata i swung it to hard that i ended up hitting him before caps even sAy anything one of his aunts said that is the way id be getting when ever id get bothered at him caps startING OUT slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most i was even reader then when i was listing all i thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happen caps then personal mon was already getting the cake out I just left from where i was at to go help her out once we all got settled to sing happy birth day to location we where still laughing of what had happen thing is they where still talking about it how it might be the same when we get married again i didst know what to say so i just simple everyone was leaving and right before i could call my dad he was already outside the door all i said was thank you Daddy with a sIlly smile,36

12396,caPS only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside A guy was crying on his chair with his hands over his eyes a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guys pride there were not too many people in the room to start off with the guys head rose up the tears seemed to eat the self sturdiness of his normal self and caps spoke to the person who always sat to his left caps just don't understand person the broken voice cracked on words i don't care that caps play in cascade winds or that caPs get private lessons or that caps ave gone to state honor band this month sound like a terrible reason but i just want to play first because i want to play first and caps never let us play first caps was right about one thing person really never let us play first i somehow understood where caps was coming from caps my freshman year i had always sat under him and him under someone else and so forth i had never seen him be first chair on anything and now on his senior year a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair in short caps is four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room the feeling of all his hard work turned into mediocre in his face with time had broken him to tears person was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove caps she had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival band camp and would be going to location as an ambassador of music still something about her having first part still did not feel quite right maybe caps was my sense of wanting superiority as well person took in the words leaned closer to say i understand that caps want first caps with confident tones she said but right now we need specific players in specific spots have played harder music and my skills are whats needed on first part i understand what your feeling live been there before caps struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior how could she have felt what caps was feeling shed been a prodigy child in caps caps from the start i sided with person but caps i realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band so i tried siding with person but caps all i could think about was that this was person is last year to shine as a caps caps french horn player they kept going at each other every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile i had to think faster caps the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co operation would be useless more importantly i would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent i slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts caps a man has no socks i liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings caps so will and that is as far as i got i thought caps was brilliant their faces said otherwise so they called me crazy and giggled caps they made fun of me and laughed thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say caps stopped crying finally and person got my message that caps was a senior and did not really have many more chances at playing first chair in caps caps band they settled the fight with a simple deal caps would get fist chair as soon as we stopped competing caps caps have been the enter of being made fun of but as annoying as caps gets sometimes its usually funny for everyone including myself i cant even begin to imagine what band would be like caps their enmity had risen to the no forgiveness zone there had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so caps caps made caps hard to breath right having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip each others faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other or opened their eyes to how long they re going to have to sit next to each other i they were to continue fishing either way caps is definitely changed the way they feel about each other i have not heard them compliant about one another for a while caps is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and person for better or worse can't wait to see him play,44

12398,eVeryone loves to laugh I don't think everyone understands the effect laughter can have on two people though For example there can be two complete strangers who have never seen each other before in their life as soon as they start laughing they could become good friends you All never know how close you can be with someone if you don't ever sit down and talk laugh and get to know them you could go your whole life being at caps with just a minute amount of friends but then there could be numb other classmates you be never talked to that could also become your friends too i'm sure just getting to know one another would make a differEnce in someones life because for me thERE has been many situations where laughing has made an impact on my relationship with someone especially with my best friend person when i first met my friend person we did not know each other at all but laughing broke the ice a simple laugh made us comfortable and everything was less awkward as soon as we started laughing more and more we couldn't stop the rest was history i went to elementary caps with person for numb years and never talked to her but then when we got into numb grade we started hanging out with the same people and started talking more by numb grade we began to hang out outside of caps and talking sharing secrets and having sleep overs but breaking the ice is not the only impact laughing can have on a relationship when i'm with person i know i can trust her and everything is fun we always have conversations to talk and laugh about you could say it made us closer by the time numb grade came we were best friends we had sleepovers every single weekend at one another house when the date before our numb grade year at the caps caps came we were spending weeks at each others houses there was not a day that went by that we were not together talking or making plans over the date to hang out now we can be ourselves around each other we can always have a good time making people closer is just a small part of the effects that just one laugh can DO to two people when i'm sad about something person makes everything better also vise versa i make her feel better too we always have each others back i know we will always be there for each other I'll always have a shoulder to cry on we have become such close friends that when person was having problems at home she needed a place to live in order for her to not have to go to the caps caps caps caps so she moved in with me it has been the most fun living with her we thought we would start to argue and not be as close since we would always be together and probably get annoyed of each other but we have not person and i can hang out numb and always be together its like having another sister person and i are super close and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of caps caps until we graduate its amazing to think us being best friends and tremendously close living together always being together and being totally comfortable with each other on everything just started out with a simple laugh when we first started talking in the numb grade this is why i believe that just laughing can make two strangers that have never even spoken can turn into being the closest of friends,42

12400,I agree when people say laughter is what mostly brings people together iN my opinion numb of the time your talking to someone laughter is needed it is what brings the dullness out of a person and makes the conversation interesting Only when you are talking about something serious you done need to include laughter but ill explain later So I can easily tell a true story about laughter from my life Right now i have a perfect group of friends sUre there are times when they mess up and act like kids but i feel like i need to forgive and remember that they are there when i need them aNyways i can remember the first time i met each one of them and the one thing that started our friendship was a joke I can't exactly remember which joke we shared but i do remember that we all had the same taste in comedy aNd once we saw that neither of us were serious and dull people made us want to spend more time with each other That is why laughter builds a string between different people and brings them closer together day by day sO as time passed my friends and i were really drawn to each other whAt i mean is that from time to time we were happy to express our friendship through jokes Sometimes the jokes are really stupid Many of them have caused pain physically and have caused us to bring revenge on each other But that is just how we stay close to each other Day by day when we see something funny on the television internet or real life we always show it to each other and know that after showing this prank or whatever it is the other person will find it very funny iT makes us feel closer and know we all have a same taste in at least one field I can give one clear example of this i was watching a comedy once and the comedian was talking about his childhood and a prank he once played on a strangers house Right when i saw this video i knew right away my friends had to see this because i knew from past experiences that they enjoy these types of laughs aNd i was right as soon as they saw the show they were amazed at how funny it was and they were glad i shared it with them we got closer than ever I want to share one more example from my life about laughter bringing two people closer sO after telling you that laughter gets me closer with friends i also want to point out that laughter brings out a since of outline when if you talk to girls or boys if you re a female so i met this one girl and every time i talked to her every time i had to throw in a joke or a story that would make since to our subject aFter a while she started joking around and making stories too shE told me that she saw me as a different guy comparing me to other people she Said that she meant i want a boring type of person and that it kept her wanting to keep talking to me I always hoped not to be a dull person and jokes made that not happen nOw me and this girl are closer than ever and the root that started this relationship was laughter so as you see laughter makes any relationship happy and open of cOurse in talking about the relationships that are playful i meant there are people out there that take everything serious and can't take a joke But i would really encourage you to take laughter in your life if you already haven loOk in my life i used laughter and gained a lot of friends of all sorts just by joking around about something stupid You don't have to say stupid things but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you use laughter,40
12401,These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life caPS All started in the date TIMe when i was like numb years old and my cousins were living with cAPS cause they had just moved down to lOCATION from locATION CAps was fun having them around caPS And my cousin persON AND my cousin person who lived right next to cAPS would always ride bike Some times joey would take my bike with out asking cAPS and i would get so mad at him he would take my bike like if capS WAs his caps aND My cousins would always race down the street with our bikes i was alwAys the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a person capS WAS a cAPS bike witcH IS a bike made for the dirt and to race caps and my cousiNS Would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made caps was just dirt but cAPS was hard one day when caps WAS raining so hard caps pERSOn perSON ANd anoTHER Neighbour of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said caps was okay sAME with person Joeys cAPS said he could not cause capS WAs raining hard outside but he still came outside we had got all muddy i and fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while caps WAS all muddy then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike by the tiMe we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt my caps was maD AT caps cause i WAS so muddy so she send caps straight tO THe shower caps and my cousins HAD a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super person bros for super ORGANIZATION if we were not playing the super ORGANIZATION riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since capS WAs so hot out side We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating caPS My cousin persON AND my friend person WOULD always trade caps carDS Or caps caps CAPS cards back then every body had cAPS or capS CAps CAPS caRDS i had piles of cards caps was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park wHen i was in nuMB grade capS PErsoN CAPS anD PErson capS WERE liKE The three amigos we would stay at ORGANIZATION house like almost every weekend we would always stay at ORGANIZATION house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide seek and cause peRSON Had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games one Time on ORGANIZATION birthday caPS PersON AND caps slept over at ORGANIZATION house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto cAPS caps CAPs waS A cool games I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person if your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with likE i would always hang around with persON AND person CAUSE they would always know how to make caps laugH SO that why i think laughter is important to have with friends or family,30
12402,sOmeone once said laughter was the best medicine to me it was like someone was saying caps LIFe iS not gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you caps caps that is what i did for a while but laughing at everything got old very quickly sad to say i still laugh at most things even sad things i laugh because i think that if i do then everything will just get better that is not even close to what really happens in fact it caps only cause more pain and suffering in most cases like the time where i met this guy named person he was amazing most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset he was a human nothing more and nothing less that is how i saw it and that is how he saw it too when we first started talking to each other it was between notes i would give my friend caps and caps would give them to him he was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper instead he had caps tell me what he said then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then i would read them and answer back it was fun for a while but i wanted to actually meet the guy i had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god he did not have a wreath over his head with one of those caps god skirts nope he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real nam rata he had jet black hair he dyed it bright green eyes and a smile that could shock the whole world signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but i never listened to them they only made my life worse so one day a few of my friends and i were in location location with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when person my friend starts text messaging someone i was a little curious so i asked in a friendly way who it was caps said it was person and my heart seemed to jump caps you tell him i say hello caps caps told him i said hello and he asked if i was really there and person said yes that is when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day we talked all the way back to location a few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other he was very kind and never did he have a bromide moment he told me about his family which is a little strange but i don't judge his life his future what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug another of caps is friends said the same thing but caps said he was not aloud to i talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit i told him about my life but there really was not much to tell since my life has always been bromide i thought we could actually make things work between us that is until he moved to location i was a little upset but it really did not bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him while at school one morning person came over to me and had a careful gaze i asked what was wrong and then caps asked if anything could ruin my day i told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it i knew something was wrong and that it had to do with person but i just acted oblivioUS To it HOPIng it would lessen the blow i knew was about to come caps said he had told her it was not going to work out between him and i i sat there and like the idiot i was i said i knew it was not going to anyways he was him and i was me caps said he was sorry and all these other excuses but i wouldn't listeN instead i ignored it and went on with my life like i think everyone should of course a few months later he asked person out but i let it go just as caps did when caps said no to him and they stopped talking to each other so who ever said laughTer was the best medicine obviously had not experienced the after eFfects of it all,34
12403,Trust is a huge deal between friends fRiends agree on the same things say an honest opinion about it and don't lose the trust between a great friendship You never know who can stay by you with a full amount of trust between you two When you trust a friend you depend on them to keep things between each other Just like my friends and I We agreed on telling each other everything that has happened and not to lie about anything We agreed on everything based on trust Our friendship has always been great with not lying to each other Telling each other how we feel about certain things Then we put all our opinions together and come up with a solution that we all agree on tHat is why you should depend each other like a team when you break a trust between a friend you probably won't get the same trust you had before you don't really get told anything as much as you use to an its like you neveR should have lost the trust with a friend you don't seem to be the same because you are not trusted that much you get told it was your fault lying or for any reason to be not trusted like this one time one of friends did not tell me the whole truth of what she was doing behind my back tIll i found out what she was doing i lost most of my trust with her shEds not trusted as much she was before but we are still friends that is why having trust is a big deal in a friendship or any kind of relationship you learn to trust each other in different ways get to know each other more by having the trust between you and other person you get a lot more attention when you have that trust with other people you don't seem like you are left out on anything you see that you can trust more people to when you get to knoW them who knows that you have trust for another person who is not your best friend so we all know that trust is a hUge deal between two people or maybe even more you need to work together for the trust have a good friendship or relationship to anybody as long as there is trust between you guys my friends and i have learned a lot from trusting each other in different ways,44

12407,Laughter is a major component in a relationship Laughter once saved my best friends relationship with his girlfriend They had just gotten ito the biggest fight I have ever seen The fight started over something so small and insignificant that neither of them could remember what it was tHe fight had a snowball affect until neither of them knew what they were fighting over Then one day while they were taking a break from fighting we went to see a funny movie A while into the movie I got up to go to the restroom and when i got back my friend and his girlfriend were both laughing hist ricky I asked them what was so funny but they wouldn't tell me capS the movie we went to a cAPS rest rant for dinner While we were being seated my friend mumbled something i couldn't hear to his girlfriend and she burst into laughter I again asked what was so funny and again they replied that it was nothing dUring dinner which was extraordinary for cAPS food my friends girlfriend got up to go to the restroom caPS She was out of earshot my friend turned to me and said capS All never believe what just happened mE and her are not fighting any more caPS Caps LEFt to go to the restroom I asked her if she could remember what we were fighting over and she said she had no idea and was just fighting because she did not want to loose the argument capS SHe said that i feSsed up and said i was arguing for the same reason this made us laugh so hard because we both realized that the argument could have been over long be for that night caPS this I almost never heard of them fighting again tHis was until they got into another argument when she moved out of state tHe argument was over the fact that he wanted to do a long distance relationship but she did not want to Since laughter saved their relationship for a little while I strongly believe that Laughter is an important part of a relationship It also serves as an excellent ice breaker for a conversation,32

12412,Laughter is like feeling your alive that nothing else matters the pain in your life releasing and the feeling that everything is alright You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they are not funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little when someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them or do you fall on the ground laughing personally i fall on the ground laughing hysterically you can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little makes it less tense in the environment i have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it my friend and i have been going on adventures since the third grade we go on walks and get lost we built forts in the middle of nowhere we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks and we climbed over fences to pass the time every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family after all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have let me tell you about a good time i had laughing so hard i even started crying when your little you think things are a caps more challenging caps they really are or things are a caps more taller caps they really are but that did not stop me when person and i were about numb years old we loved playing outside climbing the trees burying old treasures to find when we grew up and spying on the neighbours well on this particular day person and i chose to spy on the neighbours we enjoyed doing this cause they had kids animals and tons of cars so they were outside a caps person is dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky more like a spike and more secretive eventually person is dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for we thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them being brave as i was i volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after i was done organization could try don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence things don't turn out like you would of expected as i got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and i was afraid so i held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is i pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands i have ever seen after the wild adventure we had i needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning so we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there i noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so i turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour caps organization and i started talking about what had happened i thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because i was laughing so hard without laughter person and i wouldn't have the friendship we have today laughing is the main source for friendship i feel all the adventures person and i share well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterwards you can look back at things and be like caps that really sucked or you can look at things and be like that is hilarious caps laugh tell you cry i could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else if friendships were based without laughter i don't know if they would be as good well at Least i know some of them for sure wouldn't be the saMe,37

12419,the element Of cAps and Laughter Laughter is an important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood lAughing is a good part in a persons life it shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a laugh Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their emotions other people laugh to hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at peoples accidents while others don't Emotions are a big deal in a persons life Some emotions are joy sorrow jealousy fear or anger Being happy makes people want to laugh at something sOmetimes when people laugh too much they will actually start crying from it People like other people cAPS are in a happy or joyful mood because then they can receive those good feelings as well therefore it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well Another thing that makes people laugh are jokes Some jokes can be very funny other jokes can be gross and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them But jokes can get complicated at times to a little kid you can say capS CAps cAPS is theRE Caps caps caps caps caps don't cry about IT It was JUST a JOKE and tHE Kid WOULd be laughing but to someone caps is older you have to think a little more to get them to laugh people love laughter they like laughing at peoples jokes and especially at hilarious pranks sometimes pranks really are not that funny like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get ranked is allergic to garlic but most of the time funny things help people cheer up when they are down furthermore accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times but at other times some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other for example a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all it is like when someone says that they a really funny joke or something hilarious to say and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around you might think that you have something funny to say but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that was not funny at all in other words laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life it is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time be happy laughter is a good thing people love it so don't always Be serious and aT LEast share some laughs with your friends or loved ones,34
12420,Laughter Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable bring two people together or just show your having a good time In my experiences laughter comes at the best of times On a typical ORGANIZATION day at ORGANIZATION I was sitting with my friends at lunch time just hanging out talking about whats going on in our lives when i notice a girl sitting all alone I don't recognize her she must be a new student I ask around to see if anyone knows anything about her no one knows Looking back at the girl she looks very lonely and in need of a friend Curious to meet someone new I walk over to her and make conversation after a little while we relax and start to talk about our interests I remember her saying something funny and I started to laugh she begins to laugh at my laugh being as its almost hysterical sounding and everyone thinks it sounds ridiculous At that moment as were sitting there laughing together I realize its bringing us together making us closer despite the fact we had just met but ten minutes ago Laughter makes life more enjoyable and happy knowing that you can share that with someone you have just met or someone you have known your whole life is magical Its a universal language that everyone should speak Laughing is healthy and good for the heart,29

12429,Laughter is such a marvellous element to have in any relationship For instance if you can't find any form of humour in a relationship than I'm pretty sure there is no strong connection between the two of you For example I was in a relationship once where we did not have that element of humour and i truthfully did not enjoy that relationship that her and i had any type of relationship needs laughter rather its friendships boyfriend or girlfriends and even family all different types of relationships need some form of humour to survive sometimes families don't have that humour for each other But they'll still have that special type of a friendship the reason for that i believe is because your family will always be there for you unlike most friends would one way i know this because one of my friends really liked a guy i could have sworn she month have even loved him when he told her that he started dating some girl she had cried for weeks than when she was at her mods house one of her brothers she believed hated her said he wants to hurt the guy that had made his younger sister cry they month not of had a humorous friendship or even a friendship at all but i believe laughter is not necessarily always needed especially within family all types of relationships are like plants the flower is the relationship and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong but without that water the plant wont grow just like laughter in a relationshiP i knoW that if i knew someone who i did not find to be humorous i know our friendship would not be very strong unlike someone who i felt was hilarious laughter is always a imPortant element in everyday life for instance if you are going for a job interview you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression for yourself one way of doing that is through laughter i have heard of many stories about job interviews a example of one is my mon had a interview not to long ago for a caps job and she told me about her interview and she said they had really connected their was also some seriousness and some laughter in that interview than three days later they emailed her and told her that she got the job and that they would love to hire her and i have heard of interviews where they did not get the job my sister had a interview once for a pet kennel type of place whEre they drop their pets off there while they go on vacation and she said that her and the person interviewing her had no connection which had led to no humour or laughter so i believe humour is such a marvellous element to have within a relationsHIP because with laughter comes greatness and happiness,32
12430,Laughter is key You never really think about laughter in importance but the truth is laughing brings the most opposite people together lasT year i meT one of my brothers friends in school We never really talked but she seemed nice We had a class together and we started talking more and more everyday and she was best friends with my best friend perSON WAs her name and she drove a bright orange ORGANIZATION We hung out after school one day and I leaned the passenger seat all the way back and was sitting on it like a dog and she slammed on the brakes and I flew into the front of the vehicle and I couldn't stop laughing At that moment I knew we were going to be friends i was a freshman so i did not really know anyone and she was always nice to everyone so we started hanging out more i lived about numb miles out of town and her brothers went to school about numb miles past my house so we had to go pick them up we bought a game called caps caps and there are tons of little jellybeans that were flavoured like vomit centipede dirt rotten egg etc so we were playing while we were driving out there and caps had to stop the car nearly numb times in our numb mile drive those were the nastiest beans ever then we would drive out to my house and wed listen to our favourite country songs and blast them in her car she was my ultimate best friend and no one could replace her whenever we would get in fights we wouldn't start drama wed always have an actual fight because by the time one of us were pinned the other was laughing too hard to do anything about it her dad and my dad became friends later on too and we would always have barbeques and family get together we also talked in a caps accent all the time because one of our friends was from location wHenever we went TO caps to go shopping wed use our accent and everywhere we wENT people would ask us where We were from before we knew it our dads started talking like us we also created a bunch of slang words and then the whole school started using them she is a great friend and she keeps me laughing everyday whenever person was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and i would always be there for her she always called me sister instead of caps because we were so close she used to take caps and caps classes at my old high school and when she got the fake baby doll it would keep us up late into the time that baby was crazy person would be driving and the baby would start screaming in its car seat and wed have to pull over and find out what was wrong with it shed be a good mon she always cared for things even the smallest little thing she would cherish one time we painted her little brothers room because we were bored and person was rolling her paintbrush in paint and texting and she took her eye off of her phone and dropped it in the paint she couldn't FINd iT FOr like numb minutes and by the time she did find it it was totally covered in green paint i laughed at her for so long and those are the moments i wish i could bring back every time we hung out i would laugh and i realize now how important that laughter is to me about six months ago i moved to a whole different state and i don't see her very often there is no one like person she could make me laugh and was always just numb minutes away when i needed something now i have to drive about numb hours to even see her i have not laughed like she made me ever since i went back to visit LAUghter is key as i stated before anD if you frown you all never know who is falling in love with your smilE,40
12431,a few years ago when i Was numB I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the colour of the clothes people wear I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of cAPS i diD really caps IN School and I also had a very up attitude caps clothes were all very bright and happy colours i had a theory that the less someone laughed and the darker coloured clothes they wore would make their mood and attitude would dip the experiment would last one week and in that time i would try caps to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until i got to black to see how i would be affected if affected at all to get started i had to first tell everyone what i was doing and ask them to try caps to make me laugh on purpose then i had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colours on them that was the hardest part because i saw a lot of cute clothes but they were too colourful after that i only had to wait for the date to end and date to begin date time i woke up and did caps usual daily routine then tried on caps new clothes when i got to school i noticed the surprised looks from caps classmates caps they took in caps outfit caps was pretty tough caps to laugh at some of their expressions but i couldn't because that would ruin what i was trying to accomplish throughout the day i got comments on caps clothing and some of caps teachers were worried because i was not laughing caps usual but when i told them of caps experiment they understood and said caps luck caps the day came to an end i was satisfied with caps success and quickly fell asleep the next two days went pretty much the same and i was wondering if caps theory would be proven wrong but on date time caps mon pointed out that i seemed different caps caps okay she asked caps don't seem caps ENERgetic time and your caps smiling at all your caps sick caps caps i told her that i was fine at school i was asked the same thing and after a while caps got really annoying i got mad and yelled at them which i never do and they apologized but i felt bad and told them i was sorry and they forgave me telling me caps was probably just the experiment i got a little happier at the thought that caps theory might just be correct that day went by slowly and i was glad when caps ended date was the last day of caps experiment and for that i was happy i did not mind the dark clothes and i liked the way they looked on me but caps was hard caps laughing and caps was starting to make me feel depressed that day i decided to wear some of caps bright clothes to see if caps would change anything and when i got to school some of caps friends did not recognize me because they got used to seeing me in caps other clothes i did not feel any different from when i wore caps dark clothes in caps i had to stand in front of the class to give caps conclusion caps theory has been proven semi correct i stated caps laughing did have an effect on caps mood and attitude i was yelling at caps friends and feeling sad when i shouldn't have but i found that wearing dark clothing did not change anything caps teacher then said something so funny that i couldn't help buT laugh and everyone applauded and said caps back caps caps feels really caps to laugh again,44

12439,Human beings are unusual Okay were weird there are so many people in the world including ourselves and the only way we can like ourselves is if we can get others to like us if that is not strange enough we still don't like ourselves no matter who likes us just what are we thinking we are always using relationships to assist our understanding of who we are its a gamble to even have those relationships face the facts we risk so much on relying on others we give them the ability to build us or break us our major goals as youngsters is to find people to like us i think it might even span to later times in life than that from my experiences i know there are two key points in knowing a person can build us trust and kindness finding builders with these traits is as easy as understanding if they bring you Joy or not a person can give you joy by simply being kind tO you but if you want a whole swarm of friends then this is not exactly the best way its not that kindness is a bad way to make friends its just that its not the fastest method if a builder is kind then of course you would become their friend in time in order to immediately know a friend when you see one they will make you laugh laughter makes us enjoy our time with our friends its a golden rule in the book of caps if there is such a book and it was through laughter that i made my experience in caps class better caps class to me was extremely stressful every day we had either a speaking assignment or we had paperwork and the class was really slow why was it slow it was slow because we could hardly get through one set of instructions without some group speaking or finding some other way to disturb the class a good example would be this one class project we had to do as usual instructions were slow i was at my boiling point today seemed different though despite the the usual annoyance not a single student asked for a repeat on instructions in fact they all seemed to understand and immediately started working i too followed in with this action the assignment was each group of about three to four people had to create a script using the vocabulary learned from The supplied booklet it took a whole class period and then everyone went home to do their other work the next day we returned to caps was definitely an interesting one the teacher had all kinds of strange props lined up for us apparently we were going to have the audience act out our script our job was to read it out loud my group was first to entertain and we had finally selected our volunteers and actors tiffany person and i sat down in the back of the classroom ready to read the script not sure what the actors would deliver our play was a success by the end of the first sentence everyone was giggling as we moved further on to the next play the laughter had grew louder students were really enjoying themselves and more people volunteered to preform until it was difficult to choose actors even i the classroom snob was enjoying myself the plays were fun and random some play would send everyone into hysterics i can easily remember one of the groups making mE laugh so hard that my sides were aching tears lined my lids and it was almost impossible to breathe this project was definitely the best one i had ever participated in its moments like thesE when we build strong unity in the classroom we enjoyed all of the people around us and we enjoyed ourselves i was so use to being angry at my classmates that i was taken by surprise on that one day enjoying their plays so much i now look at them as an entertaining group of students rather that the annoyance i had seen them as before no longer are these people strangers in the hallway now they are family it really is amazing how something as simple as laughter can change ones outlook on others and themselves,43

12445,Everyone laughs differently some people laugh so hard that they cry and some don't But one thing that they have in common is laughter People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy or happiness or even if something is just really funny to them Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something for instance maybe you are having a bad day and then one of your friends comes up to you and tells you a funny joke It makes you feel better right Having a good sense of humour is something that can help you get through tough situations embarrassing things or even like I said just a bad day Being able to laugh at yourself and even something that you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it Whenever I laugh I always feel better laughing reminds me of all the good things in life Laughing reminds me of good times I have spent with friends and family it reminds me of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years and that we can still laugh at just as hard as we used to I believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger When you laugh at things it creates long lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about them again in the future you will still think it is just as funny as before Some of my best friends laugh at everything they think that every little joke is the funniest ever their laughs are unforgettable you can always hear them laughing Which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy If you believe that you are not a funny person just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and most likely start laughing as well I enjoy getting to spend quality time with some of my closest friends and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to ORGANIZATION for the beginning of daTE Before going into high school It was two days after our promotion graduation from middle school We packed up my family is car and headed out for ORGANIZATION Not even half an hour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on We always create great memories and this one was already in the books for one of the best i am sure that the car ride for my mon and aunt was just as fun we sang songs and danced as much as we could buckled down in a seat to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours Of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a CAPS fire drill around it All the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny wE made a boring moment fun Once we finally got there we did not hesitate to drop off our bags and grab our bikes and take off and explore tHe weather was so nice not a cloud in the sky During our exploration bike ride we laughed told jokes and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school The next day we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft sounds like a fun idea Well it would be if we actually knew where we were going i used to do it all the time with my family so i had an idea of where to go but still five girls two rafts and a river maybe not such a good idea During the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars Knowing us we laughed the whole way down the river Whenever we passed people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us by how much we were laughing and enjoying each others company By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry good thing my mon had prepared us some lunch for when we got home when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mon did not know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh You know you have built a good friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other aLl because of one little thing called laughter,40

12449,When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so mOst perfect days in peoples teenage years are in the date beyond the stress of school my perfect day was not in the date nor was it on a crazy date break in location my perfect day was on a date in the middle of month in date it was on this perfect day that my friendship with organization was founded a friendship that is now the best one of all a friendship that is based on fun times memories story telling and laughter by date i had spent multiple weekends with organization however none were as hot as that weekend in late date we decided we needed to cool off and with that said we set off for caps down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed arriving in caps was peculiar because i was so far out of my comfort zone it was also peculiar because i had not met a single soul organization was about to introduce me to when i first lay my eyes on person person person and person i couldn't fathom how organization haD MEt them she is athletic driven pRoper and intelligent the boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks fishing poles and a loud country band i did not think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another as the day progressed i found my comfort zone again as the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged i realized just how similar we all really were i did not think that all of the childish things we did that date in month would matter to me months down the roads but they do when we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried i realized just how perfect the situation was if that day wouldn't have broUGHT laughs to my lips and my mind to its comfort zone IT would have been a day long forgotten if you go back on eVERY HAPpy Memory you have there is ALWAys one common ground A JOke or EVEN a Funny face makes you laugh extremely hard every time i drive through caps i think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs i think about ORGANIZATION and i running Through the trees laughing and tripping over oUr own feet i think about persON AND PERSON LAUGHING AND POINTING AS WE ATTEMPTED TO GO SWIMMING AFTER ALL OF THE CRAZY RUNninG and swimming we were quite wound up person person and person asked us to take a walk so we accepted and off we went into the brush within five minutes of our departure we stopped walking our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles i'm not sure what events lead up to location pushing person down the hill however i remember person pulling person down with him i also recall person sliding down to join the battle watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was Something like watching a movie about THE fifties nobody was texTing or messing with a machine around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us the day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine it was like something you only dream about once you are in a moment like that where your own little world is pulling you closer you never want to leave it when your on the laughing high you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in its simplest form you are simply you no racing thoughts no rushing emotions you are just one person i never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship on that date i realized thAt the laughs shared between Organization and i would be the first memory for what was to come every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something i think about when i'm doubtful of the world i'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living someone once said laughter is the shortest distance between two people caps that date i wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people i would have otherwise avoided laughs and smiles bounded my world into ORGANIZATION and into the world of a few capS redNecks and as of a date time that has made all the difference,45
12450,Moving around from place to place was always hard I hated the thought of never seeing any friends or family Never was the only word I could hold on to there was no point in hope it was a futile feeling I knew I would dearly miss lOCATION and ORGANIZATION just sounded so far a twelve hour drive seemed like the edge of the earth to me I visited ORGANIZATION before it was boring to tell the truth and on top of that looking for a new house would bore me furthermore all I could think about was lOCATION Now I was moving there When I first heard about the move I was infuriated and tried to fight against this poor decision I was sure that my parents were making a mistake aS hard as i fought i could not win my tears couldn't move my parents in the slightest way even In my greatest efforts I was broken and confined to the moving van for twelve hours but to me it felt like forever Finally my departure was over and my legs were sore and tired i did not want to vancouver out of my seat or even touch ORGANIZATION is soil The ground was dirty and tainted and the apartment complex was old and overly occupied the rain and mud did not help my attitude much either Everything about this place was disgusting and the thought of still sharing a room with my younger brother made me feel sick to my stomach I stepped foot out side and entered my apartment and went straight to my bleakly coloured room I sat down and collected my thoughts trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation The walls were caving in on me and they seemed to take the shape of bars i was condemned to this fast that I could not escape until i turned nuMB and that was more than numb YEars away I was stuck in my apartment for three days before I wandered outside but it was not all that horrible considering it was raining all the time even at the end of the dATE which was abnormal for me i did not want to leave my room or my apartment all i wanted to do is watch daTE Time CARtoons in my room I felt alone and out of place I had no friends to talk to my parents would it listen to me and my little brother was only nUMB so he would it understand There were no more smiles when I found out that I had to go to school the next day Aloha park sounded like some school that would have great funding and spoiled rich kids in it but it was actually the exact opposite It was an older school with kids that mostly lived in lower income housing at the time iN some ways it was rather comforting knowing that I lived the same way temporarily tHe first day of school was frightening it was my first major transition into a new unfamiliar place my teacher was old and grouchy she seemed to have a major chip on her shoulder sUddenly out of the blue she held my hand in the hallway which was humiliating and definitely not comforting I heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me I thought I would never make any friends tHe humiliation was withstand able but the thought of being in this class for the next nine months was a fear beyond belief My teacher told me to take a seat on the far side of the room next to three boys they all had the same expression which was an amalgamation of both alienated confusion and territorial pride The feeling of being unwelcome would be an understatement of the new nervous sensation that had surrounded me I sat down unaware of the actions that the three boys might deal on to me surprisingly the only occurrence was a series of temporary stares and an a card silence as the day continued life had again had become somewhat casual until the boys had started to talk about the opposite gender and my attention was directly turned towards them i sat there and quietly listened and smirked at the inappropriate conversation that i was clearly not supposed to be a part of they laughed and snickers and covered their mouths embarrassingly as i looked at them and considered them matures of the comical arts i wanted to say something that i held onto for the whole conversation and then i took my chances to add a most important joke and quickly i muttered my overly inappropriate sentence they confusingly looked at me and asked me what i had said i want sure how they would take the joke but i risked another chance and repeated it the group of boys grew silent and the only noises were those of the other students talking to each other suddenly they busted out laughing i was overjoyed that they hAd a sense of humour and after that i had frIends and caps,40

12467,Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way tHe implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it i personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my fathers side of the family One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time lAughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my fathers entire family and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it bEing that they are scattered across loCATION and very few live in the vicinity of lOCATION visiting with these family members is a rare occasion The most admirable quality of my fathers side of the family is the innate sense of humour that everyone shares lAughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well Just dATE my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in datE This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members nOt only was i to be the only guy there but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year Although we had always enjoyed each others company in the past I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities tHe day of my sisters baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise I was nervous i assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat wiThin ten minutes of doing so my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine However nervous I had been the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my fathers family My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower fOr the duration of the party all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us wE reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all thRough the use of laughter my aunt and i Reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically on this specific day and many others before and after laughter was not only an element but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt,43
12468,laughter laughter can change A lot in people it can bring people together It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing caPS Your with your friends laughter can and will always be there well i know it is with my friends and I caPS Your in a relationship or a friendship caps able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them cAPS you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that is even better because then you know your getting somewhere my best friend and i laugh all the time caps can just look at me in a way i only understand and i'll know what caps means and then we both start laughing caps we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing they all look at us funny then normally we tell them what were laughing about most of the time they don't get it my best friend and i are always together besides school we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago my best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes we only have to bring one Time of hanging out and if something funny HAPpened we will start laughing about it again in a relationship as in having a boyfriend or girlfriend one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy and laugh and love to be around you my boyfriend does it to me no matter if i'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face most of the time it works caps you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy that means girls don't get over the stupid little things boys don't get mad caps they want to hang out with there friends the best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other my relationship works out amazing because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight its nice to have all of us friends that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group at this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast and going there for a day were not totally sure though i think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time so i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it souND The wrong way normally the guys understand THAT you have a life too and it does not revolve around them my friend did that once and caps was not happy as all in the relationship caps told me they never laughed together or anything caps was afraid to break up with him tHough cause caps would not have any friends cause caps made him her life laughter can always make you feel better it a kinda like a healing process it will always be there its just a matter if someone can make you laugh theirs people that can make you laugh and caps and videos and family caps your with someone that makes you happy it is like you full of joy and enjoyment to be around them and you care for them and you feel comfortable around them if you have struggles and get through them and they still make you laugh and happy you will know that they are the one your happy and can laugh around family always makes you laugh weather you don't want to Or not i love my dad he always knows how to make me laugh,31

12471,whAts laughter if not a smile a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls laughter can come from a joke a awkward situation or just about anything laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship i'm Going to tell caps a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own it was my first day of high school i walked in the school looking down at my shoes i could feel the people around me staring at me but i was not sure if i should look back at them and smile or if i should just keep to myself so i said nothing i went to the office and i asked them how to find drama class they give me a map that i had no idea how to read and sent me off by this time i was scared a tall caps guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an i'm sorry or even a polite caps me he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway it took me some time but i finally found my drama class the teacher was not nice to me it seemed like she hated everyone she was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair her name was person and she is not in a good mood today there was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as i felt during the first numb minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing about half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name i replied caps extremely quietly as i went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me she chuckled caps caps see what sheds wearing what are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning i started laughing hysterically the large teacher lurking in front of me said caps two hallway now i did not know if laughing was an option but as soon as i stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and i fell on the floor laughing i couldn't control myself don't get me wrong i did not think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice or so i thought the next class period i walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back next to caps person was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body and a pair of hot pink numb inch high heels today she was in a great mood caps could tell by the big fat smile on her face when anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes it was like getting stung by a bee on a hot date day we would all laugh behind her back but that is the way we got through her class alive after a few minutes of talking she sent us off to caps our first scene the people in my group were caps my friend caps who i had met in algebra the day before and a girl i did not know named organization monte we all got to know each otHer quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing organization monte was caps caps as was caps organization monte was taller than me by about numb inches she had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs she was stunningly pretty caps was a quiet caps it alone type of person she was about numb inches shorter then me and she had short black hair it was straight as i would quickly learn it always was she was stylish she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a caps jackEt her whole outfit screamed adorable we laughed the whole time making fun of the teacher and telling jokes we got barely any work done that was a day I'll never forget to this day i'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day and how glad we are that we met so as caps can see laughing is a big part of my relationships its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh even when Caps barely know someone caps can quIckly find out that laughing leads to friendships its like being in your favourite place on earth for just a moment laughter iS a good way to Become close to the peoplE around caps the next time your with your friends or grouped With strangers tell them a joke priceless,36
12472,So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events like its the only thing life consists of we seem to never stop and focus on the little things if we could stop and appreciate those little things everyone would realize just how much they really have in some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story like its some sort of competition i personally don't want to have the worse story if you just go with it things seem more lighthearted care free and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad there is many times where i could have chosen to stay mad and upset but instead i chose to just laugh and not make a big deal out of a small mistake for example date was the caps dance i was supposed to be there early to finish decorating but i was late like always it did not really matter that i was late because when i got there i found out that it was cancelled by the time they decided to cancel it due to a power outage my parents already drove away and they did not have their cell phones with them i was stuck at the school while i was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up two of my friends showed up even though i told them that the dance was cancelled my friends mon was nice enough to come pick us up we met the rest of our friends downtown where we decided to go to location is and play arcade games we had an amazing time we all got matching rings and i got two lollipops when we were done we went up to our friends house where we watched movies and ate popcorn i had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper i kept saying a ton of random things but it made for a great evening full of laughing i could have been really upset that the dance was cancelled all of us could have but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time and i personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been another example is when i was a freshman there was one day that seem particularly hard i felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me i remember sitting in the hall by myself feeling like nobody cared a senior that year came up to me and started talking to me i remember him telling me that its harder frown than it is to smile i realized that he was absolutely right even though smiling takes more muscles frowning in the long run has a worse effect if i could go back to that day i wouldn't be such a drama queen i was making a big deal out of something that was not even true i always say things that i latter regret but if i just go with it it does not seem near as bad if i could i would write a dozen songs that have nO sad or depressing meaning or a millions books based on the happiest things in life if you fall down its better to laugh than to run away crying what won't kill you will make you stronger lots of things make you stronger like breakups heartaches caps a class and of course laughing laughing also makes you live longer so why wouLdn't you laugh as much as you pOssible could,40

12474,the caps of laughter Many people think it is love that brings people together But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run bEfore you be ever loved someone though you be laughed with them laughter creates conversation mends relationships and brings joy to people its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends in the kindergarten everything was new to me i got to leave my house go to school eat lunch and go to recess there were many children just like me bouncing with excitement as our daily routine started although we played together at school at home there was no one around to play with one day after school i noticed a boy walking around next to my yard i walked over and remembered him from that school day in my classroom caps was all i said he turned around and with all his might burped as loud as he could we fell into a fit of laughter and i knew id made a new friend that day from then on him and i were best friends any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing about something there was no need for our parents to set up any playmates or scheduled time to meet other children because it was easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally not awkwardly while the parents chatted from then on making friends was a piece of cake through grade school and well into my teenage years i had a best friend and a lot more friends solely because of a moment of laughter laughing is something that can always break the ice whenever you meet someone new its always kind of hard to just talk to them you don't know whether to be serious outgoing funny or quiet but if something happens that makes both of you laugh then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension in between its like riding a bike after the initial awkwardness things just get easier and easier for many laughter helps heal pain tragic things happen in every persons life and it can be hard to deal with at times whether its a breakup a depressive mood or maybe even a death of a loved one something funnY and a laugh month help them get their mind off of whatever is bothering them most of them time that is all a person wants something to help them forget what ever troubles them if only for a few minutes its how people build better relationships they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better besides its healing and conversation starting qualities laughing is simply fun to do it month start out as a small giggle turn into a chuckle and end up as a fifteen minute session of raging side cramping laughter and most of the time you re with friends so they re enjoying the momeNt of fun and happiness right along with you if you be never laughed once in your life there is something wrong it will eliminate awkward moments Relieve painful thoughts or feelings and create instant fun just try it its not that hard i guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone make life less stressful and make you happy,40

12479,iN my opinion I think that laughter is a very important part of life What would the world be like without laughter and jokes It would be a very boring and dull place I can't even imagine what it would be like The world needs to have laughter in it People need to make jokes and they need to have laughter and comedy in their life I myself have a lot of laughter in my life One day in fifth grade my best friend and I were jogging around the track for gym class We were running together and talking and telling jokes to each other to help pass the time because it was really boring I told this one really awesome joke I can't remember what it was and he started laughing so hard We were both laughing together to the point we were crying hE fell down on the track and rolled off into the grass i sAid caps ON We need to keep going or the gym teacher will get mad he said I can't I just peed my pants That made me laugh even more He got up and walked over to the gym teacher tHe gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurses office after gym class was over i met him back up with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mon and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants i wonder what his mon must have thought it was a funny day we have always talked about that day together from then on i would always jokingly make fun of him for peeing his pants but i told him a funny joke our whole relationship was based on making each other laugh and telling jokes just all around the two of us being stupid together was what we did jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that i might possibly have for the rest of my life at the same time if you have no jokes and laughter in your friendship it can make your relationship very boring and lame if you do not have any or little laughter in your friendship then you do not have fun with that person and it makes you not want to hang around them because it just feels boring i have this other friend named caps i occasionally go over to his house and we hang out and play video games together the weird thing is we hardly even communicate with each other we just do stuff and don't have aNy fun with it there is no jokes or laughter or anything awesome like that we just play his video games silently not saying a word to the other person its the most pathetic thing i have ever seen it is the most boring friendship two people could have it is really boring over there beCause we just do the Same thing over and over i don't really like going over there that much i would rather be at a different friends house havinG fun but i still go over there anyway and i am not sure why without jokes and laughter in a friendship it just makes things boriNg and not fun it is something you definitely need to have laughter is not just aN important element in a friendship it is also an important element to have in a dating relationship if you are dating somebody then you absolutely need to have laughter in your relationship if you look around you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time having fun it makes their relationship interesting and enJoyable think about it who wants to date a boring person that does not like to laugh and make Jokes nobody wants to so in a dating relationship you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship you want to keep things going good so the other person likes you and thinks your funny that is one of the key things that makes a couple close so as you can see by my three examples laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general if you have laughter in a friendship It can really impact the relationship in a very good way it makes it an interesting and fun relationship laughter makes people happy and get along with each other if you are feeling down laughter can always bring you up and make you feel better it is almost like a medicine if you do not have laughter it can really maKe things suck and make the relationship boring nobody wants that people do not want a boring lifeless relationship with somebody laughter is something that bring people together in a good way it brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends we have a good time and really enjoy ourselves laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life,41

12482,Laughter can sometimes be something that everyone shares together sometimes its used only for few as its aimed against one another but Hopefully most of the time its something that we all can share laughtEr opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another Someone could be a complete stranger to one another and then just by a simple joke laughter could make them look like they be been friends for years now laughing is not the only thing that helps people become acquainted with one another they can share similar hobbies or likes and dislikes but most of the time laughter is something that everyone needs in a relationShip i remember when i first met my friend person he was not to outgoing but through making jokes he seemed more comfortable in talking with others me and him would often talk about caps our daily life where to much to handle but instead of making jokes about it we decided to laugh about caps we were complaining when our life we easy compared to others some people have to work numb jobs to support a family and were over here complaining aBout caps we have to wake up and go TO school we laughed at caps pathetic we sounded a couple of days later we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do when we older and out of high school person said he wants to be a take and instructor and that hers already got a small job at one i said caps did you get the job HE Replied i kicked a kid in the face pretty hard when my instructor Was watching we both laughed really hard and just by that laugh we became even more of FRIends cause its through laughter that we can become civilized,29

12484,pEople can share many things daN Clothes feelings beliefs religion and laughter for my sister persON AND i laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would wHen i was younger it was the typical older sister loCATION younger sister vibe frankly we did not like each other at all tHrough maturing entering high school and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now its almost as if we are the best of friends in the date we were together constantly we would watch jerry person laugh and or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show we would watch clips of the show saturday time caps that is where i introduced her to the character caps person and i would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from caps and laugh constantly about numb time caps is also where we adapted the demonic voice we would talk to each other and our friends in these voices both of us still talk like that date as we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school we would listen to music make up random dance moves and sometimes i would have to steer if her favourite song came on she was a very energetic dancer it was all in good fun though when we would enter into the school everything would change though and i understood that after about a week i was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say i to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends she wanted to be left alone so She woulDN'T look weird she was a Junior THEN They always think their the coolest around once she was a senior she would say i to me she would smile when she saw me i even talked to her and her friends sometime we also grew closer once i entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other the single thing that i believe has made our relationship closer because of laughtER Was THE three weeks she stayed in my room she decided to move in when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from we suspected that she just did not remember getting them when she was out the time before but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them we figured out wHAT it waS WHEN her fRiend person came over she had bed bugs that time i separated the two mattresses i sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room that turned into two three weeks we spend almost every hour of every day togethER Those three weeks the only peace i got was in the shower we would stay up late talking about oUR day WHO we DID not like who is outfit we really liked that day what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done Better at cheering if you knew person you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late i was next to her trying to scare her its quite funny to see her reaction finally she moved out and i got my room Back though i don't think even now it feels the same as it did they say many things about laughter laughter is the best medicine laughter is the shortest distance between people caps two people in a room they'll be laughing in numb minutes all of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter i have the funniest silliest greAtest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things we have the same mind people say we do a lot of the same things we think a lot alike and we wear a lot of the same things as well i am positive laughter has stRengthened my sister and is relationship i bet if you really look aT the relationship between you and someone you re close to the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing,36
12485,One day i was going to my friend ORGANIZATION peRSON Is house for her numb birthday party i knew the birthday party was going to be a lot of fun even though it was only going to be organization caps and i i did not know it was going to be as fun as it turned out to be though the whole day i was waiting for it to be numb so i could go to her house i packed all my bags and got everything ready because it was a sleep over as i was one my way to her she called me and said before you get to my house look to the right the whole way my dad and i were driving to her house i kept my eyes on the right side of the rode i was not quit sure what i was looking for though as we got closer i saw something in the bushes it was organization and person i told my dad to honk at them so they knew i was there and as he did they both pulled down there pants and mooned us i was laughing so hard the whole night i kept thinking about the look on my dads face little did i know that was not going to be the funniest thing that happened that night later on organization person and i went on a walk down to the dock by location house while we were on the dock a bat flew by and person almost fell in the water cause she was so scared organization and i were standing behind her laughing so hard by that time it was getting kind of dark and her neighbours were being really loud so we ran from the dock to her neighbours house and hid and started yelling things at them to quiet down it was so funny because they had no idea where the yells were coming from so they just kept looking around confused we started laughing so hard we could hardly be quiet we had to wait a while for her neighbours to stop looking around trying to figure out who was telling them to be quiet that is not the funniest thing that happened either as we were walking back to location house we heard a car coming so we made a plan i stood in the middle of the street and organization stood ahead of me while person was hiding in the bushes the plan was organization and i were going to pretend to be in a fight and person was going to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me so the car starts turning the corner and me and organization start fake fighting as the car gets closer it starts slowing down and here come person running out of the bushes and caps pretends to fake shoot me i fall to the ground like i am really hurt trying to hold back my laughs and man did we think we got the people in the car good then we realize there is no way she actually shot me when there was no gun shot sound at all so the people in the car come up closer and they are laughing so hard that we can hear them before we can even see who it is when they got closer we realized it was just some of organization is family friends coming over for the party so they knew it was fake the whole time when it got darker outside we found a huge watermelon and took it out to a bridge by location house we brought her video camera and put it on night vision and threw the watermelon of the bridge when it hit the water it mad a really loud sound and split into a bunch of tiny pieces that night was one of the best and funniest nights i have ever had the next day all the fun continued by going to the lake and swinging on rope swings into the water organization got a really bad rope burn and it was hilarious person organization and i always have the best time together and tons of laughs a lot more happened that night it was overall a great numb birthday for organization i'm glad i got to bE There with her for It,40
12486,We all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance But looking back on the same occurrence you just have to laugh at how silly it was I recall one of these experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this dATE It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery Later that day I found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river iN the tiME I remembered some spurs off the main road from when I have driven with my brother in these woods and decided to go explore some of them near my camp I decided to go check out one across the river that looked like a fun ride As I was crossing the it my front tire hit some lose rocks causing me to fall into the water Thankfully I fell away from my motorcycle if i had not it could very well have fallen on me which out in the woods by myself would have put me in quite the predicament aFter getting my ORGANIZATION up and out of the water I headed back to camp to dry my clothes off seeing as how I only brought one set with me While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry I fell into a deep sleep When I woke up I realized that the sun had been up for some time now so I decided that I had better get going on another ride before the days out thIs time i Stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that lead up to the top of the ridge As I climbed it became increasingly warm then I broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight The sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun shine After a while of just sitting I got going again The road I was on started to taper down into a valley At the bottom of it flood waters had washed large quantity is of silt over the road and it was still muddy As I crossed it my wheels started spinning out and flinging mud at me as a result I ended up very dirty Once again I headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river tHis time i did not fall a sleep for quite some time and when I did it was a fit full one upon waking I packed up my merger supplies and headed out to complete my journey mOst of a day got me only half way to my destination so i was forced to stop and rest for the night Just setting out my tent and getting out some food for dinner and breakfast in the tIME did not take me very long Having little to occupy my time I just sat by my fire and pondered my trip and life in general wHen i fell asleep i slept soundly until tiME Waking to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing by me was delightful and invigorating It only took me a few hours to reach where my dad was going to meet me and take me home This trip helped me think and gater my thoughts It also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted Looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set backs All in all it was a very good time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul,40
12487,Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them iT is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad laUghter is pretty much a sign of happiness as crying is of sadness It is just another natural emotion any person is born with I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because if two people get along they will have many moments in life together where they are happy It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humour as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke Its always good to have a sense of humour because its something everyone appreciates also that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well one of the main things you will hear is laughter It shows that you get along and that your having a good time of course there are times when its better not to laugh or when people laugh for no reason which often gets annoying yes lAughing means your happy but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other i like when people have a good sense of humour i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them uNless that is they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously Even though it is natural you have to know when you can and cant laugh iTs a way to show happiness but in certain situations it can be disrespectful or rude Sometimes when I'm with my friends they moNTH joke around about a certain person and once it happened like this at my friends birthday party we all went to a bowling alley and as always were all standing around talking and having a good time While we were talking peRSON And persON were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation They were joking around about something and then pERSON said something as to turn him down in some way ask a joke and peRSON said that hes going to get his heart broken rIght after that was said ORGANIZATION pitched in adding again So it turned out to sound like pERSON was going to have his heart broken again As everyone laughed at it peRSON looked at ORGANIZATION with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing yOu see perSON had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago ORGANIZATION forgot about that and did not mean anything when she added again She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean iN this case the laughter caused by ORGANIZATION was meant for peRSON Who was hurt by ORGANIZATION is comment gOod thing ORGANIZATION noticed and remembered about peRSON Is sex later that day She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying How a person takes it when people laugh at them has a lot to do with friendship onE time my friends were driving to a party or home from a party and were listening to music in the car one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by perSON AT onE point while he was singing his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard pERSON sing really loud with no music Everyone started laughing because pERSON did not know that cAPS would turn off the music in the middle of something Even though it was kind of embarrassing peRSON Laughed along because it was pretty funny if pErsoN AND caps weRE Not such good friends i think for sure pERSON would have gotten mad at cAPS for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two fRiends understand each others sense of humour and know when doing something is going to far or when the other person will think its funny too and will laugh along so as you see laughter can be happy thankful annoying and or mean you just have to know when its okay to do and when it is better not to laugh Even though its a natural reaction it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing Next time someone says something that is funny first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone oTherwise enjoy life and be happy,33
12488,One day I decided to go over to my friend pERSON is house when i went over there we cleaned the pool and i ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger this was one of the days that me and person laughed more then ever we started the day just laying in her bad and watching a movie on her tiny caps i can't really RememBer what movie is was but it does not really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things after the movie waS over we went out into the living room to watch caps bob because person does not have cable in her room at the time i had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable i got myself situated on the couch and person sat next to me her dad came in about numb minutes later with a booger on his index finger he threatened to give me booger lip WHICh iS where he puts the booger on your lip and i got up and tried to run away i knew if i did not get away he would really put in on my lip because he had done it before it hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so i hoped as fast as i could on one leg i hid in person is closet and all i could hear in the background was person is laughter and her dads footsteps i waited in her closet for like numb minutes and the got out because i could tell the coast was clear i went back out in the living room and person and i laughed about the whole thing after we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool we were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there there were tat poles dirt some slimy green stuff parasites and who knows what else i wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there we got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets we did not notice the tad poles until then we did not want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew that there would dry up and die so every time we scooped a bucket full of water we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can that we had saved the tad poles and scooping all of the water out took about numb and a half hours after that we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap we couldn't find and so we went and got the shampoo we poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing that was taking too long and it was not very fun so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around i slipped about a dozen times and so did she it was hard to stay on our feet we laughed so hard i almost peed myself but i couldn't go inside because i was soaked and i had soap all over my body after thE POol was all pick AND Span we had to scoop all out the soap and water out again all of this took about numb hours but it was really and we laughed a lot person is mon came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she does not have to do it after my gRandpa came tO get me me and person said our goodbyes i went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life over all i think on this day i laughed more then ever before,40

12490,I think that laughter is very important It is very important to me because lets say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think its funny its going to hurt that student i think that instead of laughing at someone that you could be a good kid and ask him if he is of and help him up that shows that student that he really has a friend that cares about him a lot and does not laugh at him and really cares about his best friend you also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me its really not about what i get its the things i do to help out my peers i think that we should not laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and react to things like laughing at someone else i also think that if i would have fell and i got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me so that what i learn respect the students the way that you want to be respected so i wouldn't like people to make fun of me so why would i like to make fun of someone else if i wouldn't want them to make fun of me that why you should treat your peers with respect,24
12491,One day i was with my friend pERSON We had been friends for a really long time I was in a bad mood that day because my dog taco ran away and i had gotten into an argument with my parents caps asked me if i wanted to go out on a walk and i said i did We were really good friends at this point and caPS Always knew when something was wrong even though i think i hide cAPS pretty well as We walked we walked past children playing at the park with their parents and a man playing fetch with his dog caPS Was sunny and warm caps WAS during the summer time We stood on the bridge for a minute then caPS Asked me whats wrong caps cAPS caps OLD him everything that happen i told him that my dog had ran away and that my parents were mad at me i tOld him that i was sad i doNe know why i open up to him like that we hardly ever talk about our life drama were always laughing and making jokes i thought caps liked me actually i was hoping caps did i liked him i had for a while we started talking about everything that was going on in our life school friends parents and a lot more caps put me in a better mood we decided to go to the park and sit at the picnic tables we sat across from each other and sat there talking for a while then caps started getting late and i had to get home i said thanks for cheering me up i really needed to laugh and smile today caps looked at me and took my hand in his and said caps should always laugh because caps never know who is falling in love with your smile and then caps kissed me that is the a day i'll remember for a long timE i'm still with person weave been together for almost numb months now,33
12492,tHe caPS Caps CAPs extreme temperatures occur the situation becomes very dangerous iN my case the extreme weather was cAPS I lived in lOCATION locaTION AT this time and was eight years old it hapPened in the middle of date caPS An alMOST record high temperature occurred location The day had peaked at one hundred twenty five degrees cAPS and to make matters much worse our entire neighbourhoods power had gone out Nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured We lived in a gated community and everyone got along great People from the neighbourhood gathered together and put up tents for shade and provided everyone with cold water There are important things that you must remember cAPS a situation like this happens you must have a good attitude because its no help to be complaining also to not think about the caps and to help other people who need it i don't think that our community would have lasted if it were not of everyone is great attitude and spirit and of course the laughter it is so important to have a good attitude during a situation like this what is the point of complaining and getting mad for no reason i was told that it would not last forever and to keep my chin up i could tell that the many other kids and even adults who were complaining were have a much harder time coping with this situation it was very hard for me no not complain being an eight year old but i eventually managed with the help of a lot of water if you keep your spirits up and interact with people the say seems to go by much faSTER i remember caps my whole family was undeR ONE OF THE TENTS JUST SITTING AROUND TELLING FUNNY STORIES AND TELLING JOKES I WOULD HAVE MUCH RATHER HAD A DAY LIKE THAT WITH MY FAMILY THAN A NORMAL BORING ONE OUT OF THE MANY IMPORTANT THINGS YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO IS TO NOT THINK ABOUT THE CAPS IF YOU don't think about it then you will have a much better time and not be complaining it is important in many situations to keep your mind off the topic so you won't be stressed out i saw many people there who just couldn't take it they would only say how bad it was and it was very easy to tell that they were all stressed out if you try to maKe the situation a good one and not keep thinking about it then you will get through it no matter how bad it is during this caps of caps many people needed assistance the community was a big help because they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks however it started to get bad people were suffering from caps exhaustion and many of them had to be put on caps is there were several ambulances there to help people out and get them back to normal some People did need to go to the hospital and get further attention the community eventually got through the day with so serious injuries the power came back on at around six of clock being exhausted the people slowly walked or drove back to their houses our whole family walked back to the house and immediately turned on the air conditioning everyone was so relieved and happy that we were finally out of that situation even at night the day was at a low of one hundred twelve degrees we played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all our family had stayed strong through the caps while many others did not last it just goes to show that laughter is the shortest distance betwEen two people,40
12493,Laughter is such a great joy in my life If people never laughed life would be dull and boring most of my favourite experiences involve cAPS while having a good time One of my best experiences with laughter was going camping with my friends last dATE I will never forget that experience last dATE duriNg the middle of date ON A beautiful sunny date tiME My cAPS caps cALLS me AND caps me were geTTINg a bunch of guys to go camping and i should come imMediately i capS my parents to let me go with the only exception of turning in my job application to ORGANIZATION before i left for camping After turning in my application I got in the car picked up my cAPS perSON and makings for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and left for the adventure After I got to my destination after driving nUMB miles up river I did not see anyone just two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be looking caps the camp site had been attacked by bears with trash laying all around and camp fire still going i started searching for my friends i found caps passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him but he was dead asleep person and me not knowing what to do so we sat in the shade of the large trees surrounding us it was a good numb degrees outside after about five minuets we herd a splash and went to investigate we walked towards the river and found all of out friends jumping off a numb it rock into the river and we went to join the fun after jumping off about numb times each we headed back to camp caps was awake and person person caps person and myself all huddled around the camp fire caps we returned to camp and told jokes all night all of us really bonded that three day camping trip caps and joking and just being boys i wouldn't get rid of those memory is for anything after camping i returned to hOme and worked a LOT of the rest of date but ever since then have had realLy good friendships with all of my camping buddies,31

12495,The only true story that I can remember that involves laughter was about nUMB years ago at the beach i Was with my mon and my sister locATION I was running from incoming waves when I decided to run into just one wave which that wave sweep me off my feet and spun me around for what seemed like forever but was not even nUMB seconds I laughed so hard that I tripped and i started spinning again my mon had to get me up because I could not stop i got so many cuts from the sand that it was hilarious after i Got changed i Got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it thaT is the only time i Remember laughter being my true friend,33
12496,mY caPS year of high school started off less favourable than most During the end of my eighth grade year I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship and in turn started high school without any it was not all bad because i was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life of course i sulked but looking back on it now i am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better however one can't go through life Without any friends so i quickly tried to conform to what was considered normal i had luck from the start but i was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who i once considered friends and in turn took these reciPients as little more than acquaintances like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts i wanted to have real friends but i was not sure what a real friend was i suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though i can never be sure whether or not this is true so i continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch this circumstance However was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point her presence made my life slightly easier because i could confide in her and even eat lunch with her people who have always had friends month not understand but when you have no where to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely fortunately my sister was always there for me though she did skip a lot of school and whenever she was not there i could rely on her friends to keep me company i found that even if i couldn't find my own friends i could always sharE my sisters this nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my caps year i had all knew classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen and truly anything i could imagine did it started out the same as the trimester before had i went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if thing might not change after all however after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class two girls walked in and sat at my table their conversation caught my attention and held it i knew that it was wrong to listen to others conversations but i figured that if they did not want me to hear they would have spoke quietly though i can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now i remember it was a hilarious topic even though i took no part in the discussion i couldn't Help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke they then began to Laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes in tuRn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter one of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to look at her shes laughing so hard at you shes crying i could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends,40

12498,sUmmertime is always the highlight of the year for teenagers itS when temperatures are the highest we are able to stay out later and its when we have the best memories of our childhood that we will never forget it seems like there is never a dull moment when it comes to that time of year everyone seems to always get together and find something crazy and fun to do caps location and i were sitting at home with nothing to do and decided that we were hungry without us having a car we have to walk everywhere so we chose the closest place to location is house which was at the time organization we left organization is at about ten of clock and started walking around trying to find something to do we texted caps and found out that he was with person so we all decided that we wanted to hang out at organization is house we had absolutely no idea where he lived so they told us to meet them at the skate park by then it was pretty dark and we were still walking when we got to the park it was pretty late caps and person arrived a couple minutes later so we started walking towards organization is house person has the most evil cat i have ever met caps has told me stories and showed me videos about that cat a million times before when we got there it was bouncing off the walls and location caps and i were scared of it we did not want it anywhere close to us because we thought it was going to attack us eventually it did a couple of times person was pointing the laser pointer all over the place for the cat to chase it and we were just sitting there still bored they were looking through our purses and saw that we had bathing suits because we went to the beach earlier that gave them the wonderful idea of going fishing at one in the time we all piled in the car and headed for the dike we got there in our tank tops and short shorts and it was freezing we were huddling for warmth we couldn't see the ground and kept tripping over little holes and tree trunks everywhere we finally got to a little dock that looked like it was ready to break and sink at any moment person grabbed his cAPS fishing pole and marched his way to the edge of the dock There was no way the rest of us could all stand on it without breaking We were taking a ton of pictures and had a ton of fun watching pERSON try and fish and capS just being cAPS in tHe end we found something to do out of nothing When people experience the greatness in little things they realize that they could enjoy everything a lot more That night was one of the most memorable nights of that dATE,34
12499,I was about ten when this story happened to me I was with my grandma when the story happened We were at the park and I put my head in the monkey bars My grandma had went to the bathroom and I was stick in the monkey bars The kids at the park thought it was funny and were laughing at me i was really embarrassed When I got my head out of the monkey bars I told the kids that they should try putting there head in the monkey bars The other kids tried doing it and they all got there heads stuck in the monkey bars The kid did not know that I had practice putting my head in the monkey bars so that it would not get stuck I was laughing very hard at what I had just done and when my grandma came out I asked if we could go home The next day we went back to the park and I got some different kids with the same trick What I don't get is if my head was stuck why would they try the same thing tHe kids this time told there mon and dad what I did and they told my grandma and I got in a lot of trouble We went home and I was grounded for about two weeks The next time I went to the park I did the same thing tHat shows that kids will be kids,33
12500,friendship and laughter go caps in caps caps best friend and i WOUld speND HourS SItting on her bed lAughing at nothing we could tell stories to each other that to other people would just be stupid but to us were hilarious We would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying bUt that was all before the big fight We have had fights before but none like this I knew that the decision I would make would ruin our friendship and take away all of our laughter but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done sO i said goodbye capS BEst friends name is caps we have known each other sense we were two and have been inseparable sense then We love to hang out and be together tHat was until the fight were i was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and i i Remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do that to me but i dId not care enough to ask her about it so i ended the friendship it hurt but i had talked myself into believing that it was all true but something did not feel right something told me that it was not her but i did not want to hear it i ignored the feeling and just went on with life it was one of the hardest things i have ever done in caps life school was a whole other story its really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and a couple classes together it was like i had to keep reminding myself your not friends anymore you don't have to talk to her like subconsciously i did not want to end the friendship i missed talking to her so one day i said hello after that we talked nonstop it was like nothing had ever happened between us excEpt there was one thing missing the laughter sense then we have become closer we had not talked about the fight but it got to the point to where we could occasionally laugh or giggle at something one of us had said but never the kind of the laughs that we used to share i never thought that we would have been able to speak nevertheless be friends again after a few weeks we both sighed up for a youth camp during that camp i found out the truth we talked about the whole ordeal and came to the agreement that the whole fight had been both of our faults mine because i did not want to know the truth and herbs because she did not try hard enough to show me the truth during that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together the tension between us broke and fell of our shoulders like a very heavy pack that we both had been carrying we both apologized for our parts in everything and then went to dinner and laughed throughout the meal i realize now that i can't take laughter for granted its a very important piece of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love sam and i are still working things out between us but we are on our way to being closer than ever we laugh all the time and never have a dull moment we have both decided to work very hard at not having another fight between us we have both realized that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and laughter inside of the friendship i love caps best friend very much and i love the laughter that we share together just as much and i don't want To lOse that again so everyday i'm going to make surE that we laugh as much as possible and i'm never going to take Our friendship for granted again,40
12501,laughter is alwAys the answer It was freezing and dark outside The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter tHe cars kept passing and starring but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourself we didst care one bit The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths the crazy cAPS dance moves and the facial expressions were the funniest thing to us stUpid things that people do are the funniest things Because I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest aS peRSON and I were walking back home from pERSON we were dredging the walk home It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house not even that It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be Cars kept passing us but they were not starring at us yet It was silent until something popped up in my brain I had the best idea so the walk would be faster i remembered this voice my god brother cAPS that was like capS compared to me even though he is younger would always do It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining This voice I wanted to try it so i attempted to we were not even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice That was a bad idea also peRSON Started to dance and cars started to stare at us persoN was this tall thin girl that was my best friend she loved piercings and did not care what others thought of her I really didst mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird wAtching peRSON dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see I never thought something could get funnier then that until she wanted to try the voice When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing wHile i was thinking to myself i thought caPS that seemed like two minutes just to get home i knew that if peRSON and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster wHen we walked through the door of my house my mon asked us capS WEre you guys dancing while you were waling down the numb and I just looked at each other and laughed and told her she does not even know how fun it was Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think iT does not matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together dOes not matter if its just friends trying to get to know each other more or if it is a boyfriend girlfriend just having fun and messing around iTs always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there,32

12506,The cAPS is capS CAps great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life sheds currently numb years old laughing can bring a new element to relationships they embark on a journey whether it be between two friends family members or something more more or less laughter is an essential piece sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends but that is actually how i met one of caps good friends the incoming caps were participating a traditional ritual name game that the high school puts the incoming caps through at orientation they were placing us in long lines that faced each other for this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself unsurprisingly everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing but we were able to laugh if off a whole new feeling overcame the room that overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter it broke that barrier and allowed us to open up i guess it really is true that laughter is the shortest distance between two people caps back some of caps best friendships were brought up through laughter when i joined the cross country team for instance the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family we share socks caps caps tee shirts shorts water sometimes even our watches but weave also shared a great amount of laughs even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around but trust that laughing while running is not easy i think caps best memory of it all was when we had our caps caps caps the entire team of eighteen caps or so met up at location is house about a week before districts the caps had to bring snack foods caps had to bring drinks and caps brought the candy and the caps all chipped in for the main ingredient that first bit of the caps was alright but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve when it did we were caps the main ingredient to that caps was the toilet paper we were going caps on a tee pee raid the first event was forking the coaches lawn but not with just any old forks these forks were special for some reason the coach had this odd obsession with caps so in spite of that a few of the caps photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn caps i was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible i don't think i ever could have caps up with something so clever after that little stop we were onto the main event the tee peeing we tried to tee pee one of the brothers from the team but there dad had already been waiting up the other pair of brothers were next all the cars slowly approached the could sac we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights just to be safe everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape almost synchronized everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house we kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street one could have called us the worst tee peers ever then all of a sudden three figures came bolting caps on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling caps get back here you forgot something we were being ambushed sprinting back we just barely made it to the cars still something just did not feel right there was just this eerie feeling like being in a horror movie then suddenly as we began to drive away something big hit the car in panic organization stopped the car and had to get caps to make sure nobody had been hit caps get your toilet paper a deep voice yelled all the caps started screaming in terror what was going to happen now what was even going on were we going to be killed no and fortunately we were not killed that caps in relief we discovered that it was only person person and location but i might as well have had a heart attack instantaneously the whole group burst caps in laughter and i had been laughing so hard that i began to cry have ever laughed so much or so hard in caps life and i'll ever forget It laughter moNTH not have brought Just two peoplE TOgether but nearly twenty when districts came and passed i know everyone was sad to see the season caps to a close it was the caps last season and nobodY wanted to see them leave but all the greAt times we had will never be lost and bonds are caps,40

12513,Laughter can be a very important thing in everyone life because its something that can help you in many ways as Far as i rEmember laughter has helped me get thru a lot of emotional problems that I would have with a lot of my sex boyfriends oNe day my mon saw me crying because my sex had broken up with me and I got really upset so the only thing my mon said to me was that laughter was the best medical at that point i did not understand what she was trying to say but now that in getting older i start to realize what she men with that is that being bummed about something like that is just useless and that i had to live my life to the fullest because i was to young to cry over someone who i just had a simple crush on and she was totally right about that but then again its not only for boyfriend and girlfriend thing its also to keep a healthy friendship with your friends laughter is a way to show how you feel inside even when i done feel like laughing i still do because that a way to show people that in a strong and independent girl who knows how to take care of herself and live her life i also try to make the people around me laugh and just have a good time when we hang out because they create the best memories i'm actually surprised in how much a simple laugh or smile can make someoNe feel better and sometimes one person can make another one smile just by simply laughing at the most simplest things in the other hand there are people who fake laugh meaning that they just laugh but its not that they are laughing because they think year funny they are laughing because they think year acting dumb but the truth is that sometimes its hard to see whose the real people from the fake because there are many people who fake laugh just to pretend that they like you when they really done and i truly think that dumb because you end up be living that they are your friends whEn all they do is laugh behind your back but i done let that get to me because those kind of people are the kind that its not even worth to takE YOUR TIME WITH WHEN I MAKE THE PEOPLE THAT I CARE ABOUT SMILE AND just have a good time also makes me happy Because it makes me feel like have made a difFerence in that certain persons day i no i cant change their life but i can always try to make their day a little easier by just making them laugh my little three month old sister is always laughing always cracking up for no apparent reason and its kinda funny to watch because when she laughs i laugh to that kinda what i men to say when i say that a simple smile or laugh from one person to another can make a difference i mean shes only three months ans shes always happy and always has a smile on her face for no reason sometimes without knowing she makes my day even better when she starts laughing out of the blue which i think its sOmewhat cute my mon sometimes tries to make laugh because she knows that i sometimes have bad days at school and she tries her best to make me laugh because when i laugh it makes me forget about al my problems and everything but i know that laughing cant always be all good for example laughing at other peoples pain is just bad and that something that int funny and people Do laugh at other people which can really hurt someone meaning in many ways laughing can be good or bad but that also depends in the person who is laughing,36
12514,I personally do believe that laughter is very important in any relationship wHo does not enjoy laughter every once in a while i know i do my true story is on the relationship of my numb year old toddler daughter and i i will tell you why i think laughter is important how it is important the part it plays in my relationships and the benefits i believe it can have for any persons relationships everyone needs to smile and just laugh forget about the things that make you frown so you can turn it upside down my relationship with person my numb year old has mixed emotions at all times and is constantly changing the emotions range from complete happiness and admiration to anger frustration and a whole lot of stressful ness of course during all of these different feelings i always love her with every inch of my heart but during the midst of feeling so stressed out that i want to scream she will say the funniest thing or make the most adorable face and you cant help but smile and laugh which let me tell you makes all the difficulties go away for that brief moment the most cold angry and hurtful people in the world never laugh they isolate themselves and don't have good relationships with other people we all need some laughter in order to not be depressed and sad if you are always frowning and stressing out there wont be any room to look at the good things and just laugh when person does her little thing and it makes me laugh then she laughs and we are all in better moods she knows that mommy still loves her and she knows just The right ways to make me smile and i just wanna pick her up and squeeze her because at the end of the day when you think About all the things that went on in your day good or bad there really is not anything you can do but laugh and that makes your whole day worth it it does not have to be your children that make you laugh it can be any relationship with anyone maybe its your relationship you have with your boyfriend and you have been together for a long time you guys laugh right because honestly how could you stand being with a person all the time and saying you love them and what not yet you never laugh with them they never make you laugh that just wouldn't add up no relationship can really be a good one unless there is some laughter especially if its someone that you love and are with constantly the good things in life need to exceed the bad things so the more laughter the better i know that parenting is super stressful especiaLly as a teen mon and WHEN She putS That smile on my face i forget about my stresses for that moment and it makes everything better i wanna give an example of when laughter really made a difference in my Day even my whole week so you know when you have those days where notHing is going right your arguing with your parents or boyfriend or whoever and you have just been feeling like crap all day and week you have not laugHed smiled or done anything fun because the past couple of days just seem to be dragging on and on with the same old routines then the weekend rolls around and i personally find a babysitter and you go hang out with a friend or two we all get together and start talking about old memories both good and bad ones ones that make you embarrassed or ones that make you want to cry but then you get to the story that always makes you bust up laughing if its told the right way and your all laughing for hours it seems but really its only been numb minutes finally your forced to stop laughing because you were laughing so hard you started crying and your stomach hurts like you did fifty crunches and it hurts so bad yet you feel so good then we would all just lay there catching our breathe the only noise you hear is a little sputter of a laugh coming out of someones mouth every thirty seconds or so so all in all that is how i see laughter and why i think its important in everyone is lives when your sad it will make you happy and when your stressed out it makes you forget everything bad and just think about the good for a second when you have had the worst week of your life it seems like and then you finally get to have your weekend with the girls and you laugh your heart out you feel like a new person laughter is good for the soul and it exercises some kind of muscle in your stoMach too i think does not really matter who you are or what the issue laughter will make you feel better and forget the bad things,36

12522,Laughter is the cAPS capS IT caps frustrating when you can't mANAGe to get someone to laugh is caps really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile there Is sOMEThing to laugh at in every situation sometimes caps just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what caps is i personally had an experience where laughter was all i could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay last date i was babysitting caps was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frosty from organization at the time i could not legally drive anybody outside of my family so we decided to call my sister location she had the day off work so caps seemed to be a perfect day for frosty we waited for what seemed like forever for person to get to the house and finally after about an hour she pulled in the driveway the kids were so excited the four of us loaded into the back of caps car and off we went to organization when we got there we started getting out of the car and that is when i noticed something was wrong person had just locked the keys in the car with the keys still in the ignition and the car running i was still getting the kids out of the car so you a think that i would just reach in and grab them but no that was not the case here i asked person caps did you leave your car running are not you going to get your keys caps response was caps no i locked caps too don't close your door caps was too late i instinctively closed the door after i was done i had not really thought about the fact that i could have saved all of this from happening especially considering that i was the one that noticed caps first apparently i don't listen to peoples responses after i ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and i couldn't figure out what was so funny then caps hit me i felt like an idiot we were stuck in the location is parking lot with three kids locked outside of a car that was running and we did not really know what to do from there our first solution to the problem was to call my mon and have caps bring the spare capS BUt we were not really sure where the spare caps was at the time MY Mon saiD that she did not have caps so we would Have tO CAll My dad and ask him where caps was we called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid but then saiD THe caps was in his truck and somebody would have to come get caps from him because he was about to go into a meeting Obviously we couldn't go get cAPS from him so we called my mon back and she agreed to go get cAPS though at this point she was not very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity She told us to not worry about the car nothing was going to happen to caPS With caps LOCked and just go inside pERSON is and get our frosty thrOugh all of this persON and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained but they did not really need us for that They were too busy role playing me closing the door while pERSON said not to theY thought caps WAS hilarious person AND I were nOt so humoured by cAPS although we did think caps was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again iNstead of us making the kids laugh they were making us laugh we Sat at locaTION Is for almost two hours before my mon showed up with the cAPS caps TURned out that the caps wAS Not in my dads truck like we thought caps was aT OUr house hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys tHat did not matter though all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mon showed up with us not there The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day neither was peRSON blaming me for everything and making me fill cAPS tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting tHe funny part was the kids stIll today they laugh about our little pERSON is adventure caPS just makes me realize that cAPS is all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day even if they think cAPS is the worst day ever lAughter really is the caPS,43
12523,lAughter is a huge part of building friendships relationships and partnerships laugHing is the first thing you learn to do you are born knowing how to laugh its the only thing that you are born to know how to do laughTer for me is what starts a friendship if i can make someone laugh we are already closer then when we first said caps As an example when I started working at the daycare i am at now when I got the other teachers to laugh you can just tell its there way of excepting you as part of there crew On the first day of work I walked in the the daycare nervous they sent me to the preschool classroom I am pretty sure my boss could tell I was nervous and it made me laugh iT made me feel welcome to be there and like we could be friends thE children in that class room made me laugh the things they did well working with children you find out if you can make them laugh or if you laugh at there jokes they are more inclined to trust you and with that you can make them feel comfortable around you Having someones trust is sometimes hard to get but if you get it from the very beginning its easy to keep but also very easy to lose When someone is down in the dumps making them simply laugh can make everything better laughter is like medicine in makes you feel better when nothing else can Its safe to say making people laugh comes natural to I am just good at it and jokes come easily When you laugh it makes everything better Laughing is actually health and is a form of exclusive When I am at work and kids laugh it makes me feel better even if I am having the worst day ever wHen i am around people that are happy it makes me feel a lot better about myself Its even better when its babies that laugh because they are so cute when they do it,35
12524,Laughter caPS And caps ON an caps dATE capS One of my favourite DATE traditions is the visit to the house of our cAPS the caps They live on eighty forested and mead owed acres outside of a quaint old town Their small green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond with tall trees forming a backdrop We arrive mid morning We either find our cAPS in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us shovels chainsaws and other trail building implements in their hands aFter the customary hello how have you been we often wander around the yard exclaiming at the new fruit trees or hearing stories about the latest tenants of the birdhouses duRing the hottest part of the capS WE head for the shade of the lush ORGANIZATION woods A short walk will bring us to a trail I love walking among the sun streaked ferns and fallen logs treading carefully the rickety bridges over burbling streams bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges and trying to avoid the dogs as they gal mph in and out of the water peRSON knows all about the flora and fauna of the region so we get a constant stream of knowledge as we hike hE also of course has to tell us about the trees hers planted a redwood here look how well its doing a foot since last fall and a douglas fir over there not as well that big redwood is shading it too much one of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago we always walk to the end of it and discuss where it could go from there over the stream or beside it or up the hill and if so where would the switchbacks be could you really bike up a trail like that after our walk we arrive back at the house sweaty and talkative then its time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond they recently built a dock that we can jump off of a great improvement over wading in from the edge we swim for the majority of the time racing from one end of the pond to the other splashing on inner tubes having pondweed throwing battles finally we get tired and sit by the side of the pond drying off in the warm sun by time dinner is ready laura usually makes salmon accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes we drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper from the hill we can see turtles and birds on the pond bugs over the fields and more birds swooping through the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs after the meal we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the time person is favourite part of the caps is at dusk when the sun is at just the right angle to show all the bugs swirling through the air at one point all the bugs gather together and create a tornado twisting upwards into the darkening sky and then they re gone until the next caps its an incredible spectacle thousands of tiny insects disappearing at one swoop the best thing about these days is the friendship and comradery we have with this wonderful family the parents knew each other long before us kids were born so we have a lot to talk about person is very interested in science topics and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read and as with all great caps we laugh constantly i consistently get hiccups at least three times just when were lounging on the porch after our busy caps even on the most serious topics my dad or the person boys can find a joke to make usually politically incorrect but always very funny now don't even get me started on the date camping trips winter ski trips or autumn cideR pressing we do with the caps,48

12527,lAughter is one of the most important elements in ones life if you re down one smile or laugh causes your body to send messages throughout you body making you feel better scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile i believe that this is true because in order to frown you have to make your whole body look like its frowning like your shoulders and your face but only a little smile shows people that you re happy in that way my family is extremely beneficial to each other everyday when were having a conversation someone will bring up a story or movie quote that they were reminded of and say it out loud to everybody with just the right accent so that it sounds exactly like the movie and cause everyone to laugh for example every now and again my brother or sister will bring up a quote from person or person two comedians we really enjoy listening to and every person in the room would pitch in with hilarious quotes they said and this could go on all night or a little while ago my favourite movie was get caps because it was quite entertaining so we would have rampages over supper or just randomly in the kitchen quoting that one movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with non stop laughter on the other hand someone will make a random comment because they heard wrong or just don't undersTand like when we were having a dinner party at my house my family and our guests were sitting at the table just finished eating when we got onto the topic of caps caps because my little sister was learning about them in school we verbally completed the train of which caps ruled caps who they came from and caps they re other names were but according to my little sister we missed one so out of the blue comes caps about caps her intentions were about the caps but i believe everyone in the room heard caps about caps caps until we paused for a second and processed caps she meant and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped to think about it herself our family has good times filled with laughter and jokes but there are also a few very depressing times about four years ago an incident happened with my next door neighbour that caused him to be brutally attacked and pass away on our door step he was very dear to my family and the rest of the jul de sac we live in and for him to die like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up to in the middle of night after that there was a period of not very much laughter aNd fun because we were all haunted by this horror but we all kNew that his spirit was there to protect us and so whenever we thought of that there was a gap between the mourning of his loss only to be filled in with happiness and laughter i believe that my family and i have a really tight connection between each other because were so funny there is never any stress between us but always a calm sense of familiarity and bonding someone once said laughter is the shortest distance between two people i believe that whoever that person is is right even between two strangers that run into each other on the street if they stop and have a conversation and one person cracks a joke causing them both to laugh its the spark to an immediate connection and they could become friends for a long time this is one of the most important vAlues that people have and most people overlook how much it really matters to humanity,45

12532,When we look back on the past everything seems to have had a deeper meaning wHen we grow older however we see the world with new eyes we see the truth harsh stripped of the glossy film that hid it Laughter helps us see the joy once again to remember it is there wHen is the last time you got lost in laughter Studies have shown that laughter releases feel good chemicals in the body It can add years to a life because believe it or not our bodies like to be happy Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free legal and healthy Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together Through whatever is happening in our lives laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress as life gets more and more complicated as we grow older we find that laughter is harder to come by but no less needed I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future lIfe was simpler the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in Of only we knew what that really meant Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer tHrough all the memories and laughter I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family the love that you find for a friend that you treasure Laughter was the key variable revealed in understanding my relationships When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life All we need to do is to is remember not to forget The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious uNfortunately as we all grown older the future looms over our heads casting a shadow over the things we cherish There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason erases the plausibility of our true aspirations Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins wHere did all the fun go It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair All the stress makes us forget to laugh but we simply can't forget Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams so when is the last time you got lost in laughter Make it now Take the pen and turn it into a quill Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy Laugh every day because life is too short to forget,47

12535,Laughing is one of the things we do best peRSON and I talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way its just one of those things we do as best friends its our job to make each other feel better and if one calls the other crying its their job to make the them laugh and if it is funny for both caps know it was a job well done in date my uncle died i called her crying my eyes out she said everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories i had of him one of the only ones i could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though i was still crying through those tears there was laughter and i knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me person and i met date at organization where we spent a week out of our date to get to know new people and getting closer to caps that week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole date though me and person did not click at organization that week we later found out we were more alike then we thought some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship does not work well this is true yet false when caps are alike caps can talk to each other about everything yet when caps hit those differences and the other disagrees it starts a fight but fights just bring people closer together even though me and person don't see each other much does not mean we can't be best friends what if your best friend lived in a different state does that mean they are not your best friend anymore no it just means caps don't see them as much as caps would like to even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another but when we do finally get to see each other there is not a dull moment about a month after person had gotten in a bad car accident we went to skate world person was on crutches so she couldn't skate but that did not stop her from having fun and making the time full of laughter she was up dancing to the music on top of seats yelling caps wont ever see these people again in your life why not just have a little fun by the date time she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and i don't regret one thing that happened that time it was the most i had laughed in about a year we were dancing and screaming for about three hours before one the parents got their and after that we all went home that is a time i will never forget a girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had when things don't work out the way we wanted we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differenTLY but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine and iT moNTH just make caps lauGh somethings are hard to laugh about but a good thing to do when caps get to that point is think of something happy or funny and try to laugh laughing has always made me feel better and knowing that i can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good it makes me feel like i have done something good with my life that i was willing to help person with her struggles to me that makes this life a life worth living though caps cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles just being there sometimes helps theM more then caPs month know person And i have planed oUt many lives we would like to live and looking back now on theM all i can do is laugh because in my heart i know they will never happen even if WE TRY our bEst to MAKE them hAPPEN I DOUBt they will but it was worth the laugHTER and a good time to make them up and believe they wERE goiNg to happen for awhile and i know looking back in a few YEARs we will both lauGH LAUghing is a good way to get rid of fear anger and stress it makes caps think of all the good times caps have had in your life and lets caps know that caps had fun in your life though we fight in the date i don't think anyone WILL BE ABLe to tear person and i apart with all the laughter that is done we aRe true friends,42

12541,sIde by side with my best friend peRSON We begin to walk to the park the Rained on date TIME waS NOt very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in location was enough for us approaching the grass to the benches mud was dominating my shoes when i was starting to think other wise of such fun sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance the fellow looked to be in his late thirty with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him a knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him beside him a stroller with two small children one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below the father we later find out pretends his numb year old daughter is whispering in his ear shouting things like caps was that suggesting he had not heard her although we knew she had not said anything at all caps want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins is that what caps want odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away person an i then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were the laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem it was wanting to burst out of us both the man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another minutes into the video i look away since the phone was now in location is hands i feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and had not continued suffering with the ridiculous video looking up i see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction back to person i notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he had not even a clue throughout this whole interaction i had not said more than numb words in between the silent laughter and looking always that i couldn't control my persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red caps really look just like her caps know alL THESE questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us the boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk breathe by breath running i could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request just another day in location we thought but for us everyday was just something to laugh about,35
12542,Have you ever got a detention from laughing an inordinate amount in class If you have not you re very lucky i know that teachers absolutely hate students that don't pay attention in class or students that will randomly start laughing when they re giving a lecture i'm that student that will randomly bust up laughing preferably at my own jokes in class in other words i'm a teachers worst nightmare ring ring ring time for caps it was a beautiful afternoon and i was feeling great when i walked into the class i automatically noticed that our teacher was not his blessedly self but i ignored it and went on with what i normally do which is get out my caps and crank up the tunes i like to listen to music because it relaxes me and helps me focus more the downside to listening to music is that you can't exactly hear everything that great when i listen to music i have those moments when i feel like i'm in a movie that everything seems like its in slow motion but you can't hear anything its almost like i'm secluded in my own little world and no one can see me or hear me until i start laughing that is finally class started and everyone was being abnormally loud at this point i was starting to see the steam come out of our teachers ears he looked like a cartoon character off of bugs bunny the teacher was getting very indignant and impatient with the class i did not exactly pay much attention to him so i went back to listening to my music after a while our teacher was now starting to get frenzied with the class even more so he told everyone whoever talks again will get their name written up on the board and you will receive detention about five minutes later my friend person comes and walks by me and starts talking to me when i listen to music i have a tendency to talk loud because i feel like they can't even hear me so i START YELLING AND SHE STARTS TO GIGGLE BECAUSE WHEN I WAS NOT LOOKING MY TEACHER WAS JUST STARING AT ME WONDERING WHY I WAS TALKING SO LOUD HE TURNS AROUND AND WRITES MY NAME ON THE BOARD THAT MEANT I WAS GIVEN A WARNING I TURN TO LOOK AT THE TEACHER OF NO HERE IT COMES NUMB MY LAUGHTER IS OUT I COULDN't control myself when i laugh uncontrollably i laugh like there is no tomorrow caps you owe me thirty minutes of detention said my teacher one of the biggest problems that i have is I'm very easily amused i lAugh At mainly everything and anything when my teaCher yelled at me his facial expression was just way too funny so I began to laugh even harder whEn i Start laughing my friend PERSON usually can't help herself but start laughing with me She tells the teacher that she was the one that made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too sO she got what she wanted detention One week later PERSON and I arrived in good old detention with all the other rebels that is what i call myself now it makes me feel tough the thing that we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other when we sit by each other we can't stop Laughing but we decided to sit by each other anyways what do you know we almost got More detention while in detention imagine that caps is to short to live with tension and regrets so just laugh it off that motto is what i try to live by everyday i feel like laughinG is a very important part in my caps it really helps me forget what is bothering me even though i month get in trouble from laughing i don't regret it one bit some people are very serious and they don't know how to let things go so they re always tense laughing releases tension and for me i feel like it brings me closer to my friends i love laughing with my friends and the feeling of your abs hurting from laughinG is awesome live your live laugh as much as you can and love those That mean the most to you,40
12543,How Laughter cAPS laUghter can be a huge help when going through difficult times Like the time when my brother got ran over by a skid steer tracked loader at our farm we did not know how bad it was going to be caps through our time of uncertainty our family was there to be with us and help us through and keep us from getting down it was just another day on the farm and we were out running the machines the day was going just fine until after dinner my mon had told me and my brother to go out and cut corn caps mon me and my brother said in unison she wouldn't hear it and told us to hurry up aND Leave so we went down to the shop and got the skid steer out my brother person still had not come down and so i started iT and started driving towards the garden i saw my brother coming from the corner of my eye he was running as fast as he could and i yelled at him to stop and wait caps he kept coming he tried to jump on the front forks caps missed and fell i got out of the cab aNd saw him lying on the ground crying my uncle was standing near by when it happened and he called the ambulance we did not know what was wrong with him caps his leg looked a little funny so we looked closer and saw the bone sticking out of his leg finally when the ambulance came they looked him over and asked me some questions about what had happened i told them all that i could and went back to the house it was nerve racking to not know what was going to happen to his leg caps we just hoped that it wouldn't be very serious i spent the night at my grandparents house i haD a lot of trOUBLE falling a sleep that night thougH the next morning was date so i had to go to school i still did not know a lot caps i did know my brothers leg broke in a compound fracture the whole school day my friends were helping me feel better by telling jokes and funny stuff and just keeping my mind off the accident it was hard not knowing what was going on with him later that night we went to see him we learned that he had just broken the big bone in his leg and that it had gone back together just fine my mon stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital so things around the house was a little bit different me my dad and sisters had to clean and take care of the house it was a pain because i hate doing house work and having to do it all the timE was vary boring when my mon and brother finally gOt back after about a week things went Somewhat back to normal my brother HAD to ware a thing oN his leg that sucked the fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster there was giant screws coming out of his leg that attached to a bar on the outside of his leg he has healed up just fine though and has A GIant scar where the Bone came through his leg it was very nice to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us get tHROUgh and that is why laughter caps,40
12544,We all understand the benefits of laughter lAughter can show emotions but can also go to the distance of strengthening a friendship or relationship To many people laughter is a very important part of any relationship fiRst Laughter is very important in a friendship If you cant have a fun happy friendship then you wont have a good friendship Building up to a friendship is always sometimes difficult It can take up to a good laugh to not laughing at all to determine your friendship Having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings Knowing that you have someone you can trust talk to be there for you and the most important laugh with is a great feeling alsO laughter is important in every childhood memories Thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing Even though my mon and dad left me and my brothers i always had my grandparents brothers cousins even aunt and uncles to keep my busy and always have a good time I think laughter is an important thing being a child because its healthy you can learn to keep others spirits high and keep others laughing and happy and its always good to have a strong fun happy relationship with your family last laughter is very important in a relationship I think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with Laughter will also build a good and strong healthy relationship and will lead to good things If you think about it laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person your with it will lead to not getting a divorce and fighting and you will have a strong relationship so therefore after pointing out that laughter is important no matter what age what gender friendship childhood or relationship you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation It helps build a strong person and also builds character to yourself,35

12547,The members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled Broken dishes are a common occurrence in our house as are spilled drinks stubbed toes and blood chilling screams whenever the toaster pops up tHough all of us are used to these types of things not everyone around us is which can lead to interesting encounters Many people find pleasure in jabbing me in the sides to hear me scream and laugh when I trip over the slightest crack in the floor tHough it can get annoying sometimes it monTH also give me a reason to get over my pride and laugh at myself thus relieving any tensions I mONTH have been feeling about the social setting For example a few years ago i was staying with my caPS Caps TROop at locatiON Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating but it is increasingly terrifying when the group is made up of girls ages four to eighteen with only a few adults thrown in to make sure the girls do not bludgeon each other to death wOrse still was that where i was staying which was a hybrid somewhere between a cabin and a tent the majority of the girls were in middle school and needless to say we did not always get along desPite the fact that we were not all the best of friends though there were times when we were able to get past the petty differences such as who was cool and who was not and enjoy the time we had to talk and joke around with people who were in similar places in life oN one such occasion I was attempting to make my bed on one of the top bunks and was in the process of stretching my sheet over the petrified mattress which mONTH have possibly been around in nUMB caPS A bEinG the intelligent person that i am i decIded to lean against the wall behind me for balance forgetting of course that there was in fact no wall but only a thin cloth like material which could not support my weight The second I realized what I had done I reached about frantically for something to hold on to and tried in vain to keep myself from plummeting backwards to the floor and my certain death mIlliseconds before i would smash into the hard wood floor i Managed to grab a hold of one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on for dear life swinging back and forth and back and forth fInally i Let go and propelled myself almost gracefully onto the bed sitting underneath mine It was a very long time before the laughter died down iN that short amount of time cliques and biases and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a bunch of random girls placed in a room together but a group with our own strengths and weaknesses passions and flaws Though the adolescent years are incredibly difficult and there are many times when it feels like you are the loneliest person in the world it is always comforting to know that there are other people who laugh and cry just like you and experience many of the same joys and embarrassments as you do One of the most essential skills to learn is that you have to be able to laugh at yourself from time to time and let yourself be vulnerable in front of other people wE moNTH Not all be the same but we all have the same basic desires for love acceptance and laughter,41

12553,Can you imagine life without laughter lIfe without laughter is plain dull and boring lAughter is an important part in life There would be nothing to look forward to if laughing did not exist laughter creates memories relationships and it fills in the awkward silence between two people some people don't realize how important laughing is life without laughter is like life without water i think that is how important laughter really is the quote laughter is the shortest distance between two people is true but laughing is more then just an element its way more important than that well i guess we could all live without laughter but who would want to no laughter means no fun times like swimming water parks ice skating dancing etc those fun things can lead to laughing without anything fun to do no one would look forward to tomorrow everyday would be a waste if there was not any laughter in the world some people might just think that laughing is just an element why is that laughter is important enough to be more than that for example water is an element because it has something to do with the earth it stands for the ocean laughter does not fit in that category laughing has such a huge impact on our lives laughing makes everything tens time better laughing createS memories memories creates relationship that is why laughter is an important part in any relationship its amazing how the smallest thing caN make such a big difference in our lives,34
12554,The cAPS of laUghter laugHing is a huge part of most everyday life it is a very common emotion that i see hundreds of times a day whetheR it be from something as simple as a funny face a joke a picture and even little things people do or say can bring laughter to even the most serious of people caps FRIends and i lauGh constantly We can make something funny out of pretty much anything I think being able to laugh and joke around are very good traits to have as a person because it makes life so much more fun and optimistic I can't even count the number of times I have been in a complete laughing fit because of cAPS friend locATION SHe iS by far one of the funniest people i havE ever met in caps eNTIRe life Though she is extremely funny she is not exactly the brightest crayon in the box She asks questions after people already tell her the answer she says exactly what I say after I say it without even noticing that I had already said it before her and sometimes she even trips on the concrete while racing someone to her car after practice thE things she does monTH NOt be super intelligent sometimes but they sure can give anyone a good laugh I remember not even a week ago I was in the car with lOCATION on the way to volleyball practice and she just belted out the wrong words to the song we were listening to What made it even more funny was the fact that even though she knew the words were wrong she kept singing like she knew every word aT the end of the song we laughed so hard we cried by the time we got to practice her and i Had been laughing for about ten minuets straight durIng practice our caps had been explaining directions to one of the drills sHe told us loud and clear to serve the ball to spots one and five caPS LocatION NOT fully understanding the directions decided she should ask and make sure it was all clear to her So she put her hand up and asked capS SO do we caps sERVE to spots one and five caps whole team broke out into hysterical laughter loCATION Who did not understand stood there looking confused but when she finally understood why we were all laughing she joined in that happened about three more times throughout our two and a half hour practice she even got put in front row which made us all laugh because she is very short and looked really funny next to the six foot one girls standing right next to her by the time practice was over i think we had gotten a better workout from laughing then from playing volleyball on our way out to the car location decided she wanted to race a girl on our team to her car caps agreed and they took off in a dead sprint you could see the determination to win in location is face and all of a sudden they were no where to be found i ran up the stairs to see who had won caps to find location face down on the ground with caps sitting next to her laughing hysterically i felt bad but it was so funny i couldn't help but to laugh we sat there laughing for a good fifteen minutes and we laughed about it all the way home that was the icing on the cake to one of the funniest days i have ever had i will never forget that day and all the times we laughed together i think location and i being able to laugh so much together brings us closer as frIends because even if we get iRritated with each other or something bad happens we can always find a way to laugh about it in the end and that is something every good friendship should have laughter can't always make everything better but it can bring caps so someones day and you never know the positive effect a little laugh can have On even the grumpiness of peOPLE,43

12557,Laughter can not only be a benefit to ourselves but to others as well We only seem to use it whenever you feel the need to become happy but in reality it shouldn't be the only reason why lAughter is not only being able to feel better but to let out what you need to let out Being able to enjoy yourself is pride and you should feel better about yourself Whenever you laugh how do you feel Do you feel like the world is lifted off of your shoulders and you feel better about yourself I don't mean you have to laugh so loud and so much that you fall off your chair and roll around but a simple chuckle would do the trick Watch your favourite movie or go have fun with friends as long as you are laughing you will and should feel better about yourself thAt brings us to what happens around capS FAmily when i was Younger i woulD go on trips with caps faMILY up to location At the time I lived in lOCATION Every dATE we would cram anywhere from five to nine people in a van and be on our way Having hardly any space of your own you would think it wouldn't be any fun All in all we would have some fights about where to stop on the way from food or when to turn but nothing too serious Being younger then everybody I was wildly bored So to fix the problem I would make cAPS family tell jokes make funny faces do something Right when somebody would let out a joke or made a face I would crack up laughing pUre bliss and pure innocent it did not mean that they were funny or that they were even trying but to let up the intense shoulders i would laugh when we would get to where we were staying on caps great grandparents land we would cram yet another time in a small area for our sleeping everybody would get a cot and would have to endure the warm daylight and the harsh cold bitter time the cold nights were the ones that got to all of us the most because caps great grandparents had land meant that the place we were to stay at was not filtering heat sleeping bag and the clothes on your back were the only thing that we were able to get so when the sun slipped slowly from shinning its bright light among us wed bundle up knowing me i did not listen to what caps family sad and i would drink tons of water before i rest caps head against the cot if you have common sense which when i was younger did not you would know that if you drink a lot before you go to bed and having the cold surround your body you would have to use the restroom at some point during the time because caps aunt was only numb years older then me should would be the one that would have to wake up to walk me outside down the driveway to the porter potty wait for me then go back to sleep while trying to shake off the shivers that controlled her like the puppet master knowing time she was not happy with time situations i'm sure nobody would be the last time she took me she made sure it was the last time she would get up to take me to the restroom the time came that she had to take me we started walking down the driveway the wind was not like other nights ripping Every which way and piercing through caps skin another odd thing about time was instead of the dull tired face caps aunt usually would have she was awake more the awaKe she seemEd to have a slight grin oN HEr face since it wAs pitch dark she had the flash ligHt with HER she opened the door to leT me in and shinned the light down in the cracks so i would be able to see more clearly once i was done i felt the shaking of the porter potty and heard in the voice of a monster the caps A was coming to get me Run run run caps blood rushed all over warmth is what i remember feeling pushing the door open screaming running for caps safety is what went through caps mind as i realized caps aunt was not with me i looked back only to find her laughing uncontrollably at what just happened the meaning behind time would be that you can just turn a bad situation into a good one if you rearrange the problem you can turn it into a laughing matter instead of a dreaded time caps aunt making me do something she would think was funny would be a better sense for her and relieve her from whatever she thought she felt its a cause and effect pLACEmenT causing ME to panic effected HEr to be at more of an ease,35

12559,Social CAPS CAPS people think of laughter as a way of showing how you feel almost like an emotion I look at laughter in a different way lAughter is a form of communication suRe you monTH LAugh when something is funny but the truth is that you can control it so CAPS do people laugh They laugh to convey a message basically they are letting you know that what you said or did was amusing to them Overtime laughter can build relationships or even start them all because when someone laughs at you or with you you are sharing a common ground I know that laughter is an important thing in my life because without it I would have never met my best friend When I began sixth grade i was scared I was scared that I would lose all of my old friends and become one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria every day wishing that he had someone to eat his greasy pizza with Of course I was overreacting but the thought was always lingering in my mind all through the first few days Soon I even began to notice that my friends were actually find new people to hang out with and i was beginning to feel as though i was becoming that outcast i had feared to be thEn i Met him He was a skater kid with dark hair down past his eyes and white almost pale skin i was with one of my few friends CAPS when i Saw him riding around near the front of the school i dId not really think much of him besides the fact that he had some of the coolest shoes I had ever seen I was actually surprised when CAPS walked up and started to talk to him like he had known him forever I walked with him to avoid the image of being any more of an outcast aS soon as we are standing in front of him he says something like an insult that I would usually brush off as nothing but this time for some reason made me really mad I said things back and before I knew it we were in verbal warfare In the end I knew one thing I hated that kid and he hated me towArds the middle of the year our school had a dance It was the first dance I had ever been to and I had butterfly in my stomach i gOt a ride with one of my old friends date I liked dATE because he was never judgmental or anything like that he was just friendly When we were in the car driving to the middle school he told me that he had to pick some else up which did not really bother me at all until we got to the house tHe house was not very impressive it could have been a cardboard box for all I cared When i saw the the kids left foot step out of the house I knew exactly who is shoe it was As he got in to the car I pretended as if I had not seen him I failed The whole car ride was nothing but awkward When we got to the dance I walked on the right side of dATE to avoid confrontation daTE Scented the tension and stopped walking What he said next surprised me a little CAPS don't you guys just get along we both stood there eyes locked when skater kid made another one of his nice comments I thought it was going to be the beginning of the year all over again but i did something i did not expect to do i laughed he laughed too It was almost as if for the first time ever we were friends The whole night we hung out and danced like crazy wE had become friends durIng the rest of the year we became better and better friends We went over to each others houses and hung out at school That was when I realized that we were best friends Even now in ninth grade we are still best friends its crazy how one small giggle can escalate into that but that is what happened I don't know how laughter can do that or CAPS I even laughed that night but one thing is certain laughter is important,46

12566,Water CAPS of CAPS CAPS we think that laughter is just an emotion but in all actuality its practically a way of life we use laughter to cheer people up or get out of trouble people do stupid things just to make others laugh i personally think laughter is a reason to live and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives i have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better and i would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up when i was a child my friend would always be picked on at school for no reason really and i was not the type to take action or try and get back at someone but that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out she told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names so the next day i went to school with her in the morning and i took caps filled with chocolate milk smoothie egg yolks and soured milk when she pointed the girls out to me i grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest she started screaming that her clothes were designer like someone would actually care i looked at my friends face she was awe shock but i could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew i was not yet finished i then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair her scream was earsplitting the smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe or trying to use each other as a shield but it wouldn't work with my throws They started to freak out and run to the others which was a bad idea because they were all hurled together tryIng to figure out who it was by the time they figured it out it was too late i was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown It covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about I could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girls reactions were some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe some thaNked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while i looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears she ran over and hugged me so tightly i thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me its been ten years since then and i still talk to my friend she even occasionally calls me if sheds having trouble with someone at school as for the girls i have not heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools i guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives and helps people become closer then ever before my friend still says that it was the best day of her life some of the other kids who witnessed the eveNt go to high school with her now and all ask how i am and want to see me do something like it again unfortunately i had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how To deal with their own bullies themselves i imagine that some of thEm have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what i did,40

12575,wHat is one of the most important parts of a relationship Laughter would be one of the most important part of a relationship in my mind Such as my relationship with pERSON and ORGANIZATION We are always laughing almost every moment we are together someones is always making a joke But when we are all together cheering is the funniest for example when our varsity cheer squad went to lOCATION We got locked out of our bus then we got kick out of a ORGANIZATION laSt but not lest we had the funniest capS CAps CAPS that night we will never be forgotten When we first arrived at lOCATION our couch left the keys on the bus after we locked it all up oNe of the girls noticed when she went out to get her ipod We all tried to think of some ways out of this wE first tried to put peRSON Through the window But that unfortunately did not work so well because we could not get any of the windows open Our couch had to call someone to bring us another set of keys After the game our cheer squad went to ORGANIZATION Because before the game she promised we could go to get some cookie dough if we were good and did not complain about having to sit on the stands and cheer wHen pulled up to ORGANIZATION peRSON And i rAn out of the bus screaming as loud as we could One of the people who worked at ORGANIZATION said that we could not run in the building we followed the rules and started doing cartwheels and round offs down the halls instead We got stopped again and they did not mean do cartwheels or round offs down the halls either as we were walking around to find the music box we stumbled onto a baby stroller so we took turns pushing each other in it tUrns out that is not allowed in ORGANIZATION either We got sent back to our coach Unfortunate for us we stumbled on to another interesting thing it was a short little dresses on a clothing rack peRSON and I put them over our cheer uniforms aS peRSON was about to take a picture a girl who worked there came up behind us peRSON The good friend she is ran off with out telling us persoN decides to take the picture instead after the lady saw what we were doing we got kicked out The last crazy event of the night was the cAPS capS CAps For thous of you who don't know what that is it is simply when a bus stops at a stop light and everyone besides the driver of course gets out and runs around the bus like crazy people We were just about to leave lOCATION when the light turns red I was standing by the door waiting for a light to turn red i had to beg our couch to let us out as soon as she opened the door i ran out as fast as i could Sadly the the road was all muddy which caused me to fall straight onto my butt Two other people were behind me and they helped me up and then we ran around the bus bUt the light turned green as soon as i rounded the corner The people behind us were passing and we were getting honked at and not in the good way either Honestly no body cared we were having so much fun to even think about the other people aS caPS another girl from the squad rounded the corner she fell straight onto her face Then when everyone was back on the bus the light turned red again we waited on the bus for it to turn green capS and I were covered in mud Everyone one was taking the mud off of cAPS and i Then put it on them self is but since everybody was rubbing the mud it just got really dry and uncomfortable in conclusion laughter is an important part of a relationship with out it our squad wouldn't hAve half the funny memories we do that night was just one of the most funniest all of the things that happened that night were just so humorous including getting locked out of the bus getting kicked out of organization and the best of all the caps caps caps that night will never be forgotten by me or any of the other people that were there,37

12584,I used to love hermit crabs tHe cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a CAPS coastline We were accompanied by another family with four kids Put together there were nUMB kids for me to play with but the closest one to my age was PERSON He was only a couple years older than me i adored PERSON We explored swam giggled and played tricks on our siblings together Everything he did i did We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them but one in particular stood out iT was a short and slender beach On one side there was a cave The cave was loaded with hermit crabs Never in my life have I seen so many of them tHere were mini hermit crabs great big hermit crabs and even bigger hermit crabs iT was as if our dreams had come true PERSON and i created sand castles prisons and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained oUr older siblings were not interested in them at all that was alright though in our eyes it only meant more for us when it was time to leave person and i were devastated we both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beAch like this is the future it finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs we stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our good byes when my mon eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go we both had made a quick decision i had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before i thought why not PERSON liked the idea so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks his crab in the pocket of his shorts mine in my one piece swim suit it sagged at the bottom but i decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong guilt weighted down my scrawny little body like i had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit not a tiny little crab my mon had asked me directly if i had left all the hermit crabs on the beach i nodded but my voice was Absent back on the road my sister and i played word games everything was fine the music playing my parents talking and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road every once in a while i would have to move a little because i could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings we had been driving for about an hour when i let out a blood curdling scream as my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane i remember my mon swivelling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong i did not answer as the pincers grabbed on again i let out another urgent scream i then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit letting out the last prolonged scream i pointed down to my crotch my sisters urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil i was so embarrassed and guilty that my mon just laughed she said that i had already gotten my punishment for lying and that she thought i had learned my lesson i sure was not going to disagree on that a few minutes later our friends pulled over too when we asked if everything was okay they said while laughing that one of the girls had gotten pinched by PERSON is hermit crab that sent all of us laughing We never stopped laughing about that story My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends guys that I like or adults that I don't even know Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto where it counts we all bust out laughing And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment but I guess I deserve it PERSON and i both learned our lessons although I think I learned a few extra lessons fIrst of all never put and animal near your sensitive parts The second lesson was don't lie because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go let whatever it is let it go and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends I would have never lied or felt so much pain tHey were all great lessons to learn and I am very grateful for them nOt only because i became a little wiser but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter,45
12585,lAughter is huge part of life Or so that is what I believe and grew up with a Day without laughing is a waste of a day caps quote has greatly influenced my life aS well as the people in my life My mother is quite the entertainer People have told her that she should become a comedian Apparently our family stories are very amusing Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another hErs adventurous spontaneous and is not afraid of anything sometimes his decisions are not the smartest a majority of the stories my mon talks about are from when my brother was little she loves to talk about one in particular when my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities like extreme rollerblading biking and skateboarding he would try to do every trick in the book and then some caps story however does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend caps when i was about eight or nine putting my brother at age eleven or twelve we were at one of my soccer games my brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back my mon was not pleased he went to use the porto potty and he had just gotten two new shirts a white to shirt to go under a new button up it was a hot afternoon so he took off his new white to shirt but kept on the button up unfortunately he dropped the white shirt he dropped it into the rancid disgusting excrement if caps ask him it was all an accident and my mon was not happy about it my mon is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter i think about her words of wisdom all the time caps when it seems like nothing can get better think of the positives in your life and laugh because really that is all caps can do if caps embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people caps need to laugh it off if caps can laugh about it it won't matter if anyone else does caps need to get through life somehow might as well make it the best and laughter is truly the best it makes my mood better and makes me feel welcome and at home there are many stories about what my brother did or how blond i am but ultimately all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day it brings us closer a day without laughing is A waste of a day,35

12589,I have always tried to be a happy person and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life Even as a baby I hardly ever cried i was always laughing and giggling As I have grown up I have tried to keep up my happy go lucky spirits sOmetimes this was not the case but that is simply reality There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends and so far this trust has always came through and it has worked for me i often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about whEn i Was first born i dId not cry i never cried very much as a baby my mon reminds me of this whenever i ask her about my baby years as a young kid i wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me i was always looking for laughter and exciting events i did not want to miss a beat my mon would have to take drives just so i could take a nap and even then i would hardly ever fell asleep for if i did caps forbid i might miss a moment of laughter if someone else was laughing i was laughing with them sometimes i had no idea what was going on or i wondered why what they had said was so funny but i loved the feeling laughing with other people i am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever i look at my baby pictures i don't have one of those pictures where i am bawling my eyes out like you might find in most kids baby pictures in every baby picture of Me i'm laughing if i'm not laughing then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear laughter is what kept me a happy baby as a preteen i was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling i sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because i had never Felt that type of feeling before i was always so caught up in laughter that i never had time to think about the negative now i Unfortunately know The feeling of sadness and being upset and i try incredibly hard to go back to when i did not know these feelings whenever i'm feeling down i attempt to find laughter in each thing i do when i attempt this i can always find laughter and my spirits are brought back up my friends are always a place i can go to for a pick me up especially person who is my best friend every time i am with her i find myself laughing for one reason or another person and i have not had the steadies friendship but what always brings us close again is laughter our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny usually she is the one who finds this and she makes me laugh laughter is what has kept location and i so close for the past few years if laughter did not exist i can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now not long ago i was in the car with three of my closest friends location caps and person we were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favourite songs i looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces and i found myself smiling too i realized then that laughter is truly what life is all about laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life when i was little i was gravitated towards those who i had the most fun with and who i laughed with the most as have grown older that same thinking is still there i want to be with the people that make me laugh the older i have gotten the more have learned about what i need in a friend my main criteria is someone who can make me laugh if i'm with someone with a dRy sense of humour and who does not talk at all then i am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious laughter is something that i am extremely thankful for it has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life From when i was a baby up untIl now laughteR iS what always has been and what always will be what my life is all abOut,40

12597,Close people to you enjoy the moment you have shared with them and remembering it back brings laughter for what had occurred in that moment Laughter brings people you have known from a long time together because you have had a feeling for that person and for the moment Laughing at the memories that were spent with that person and enjoying it can make you closer to that person and it can be important to that relationship iN fact it has happened to me before laughter came to me when i saw a special video from my past It was when one of my favourite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party My cousin was very chubby and with straight hair but that day she was very sick from fever I was very different because i had curly hair and was short wE both had a dress on but the dresses had different styles Then everyone at the party was having fun and we were too The video got to the part when my cousin and i were bouncing up and down grabbing our dress and making a show for everyone at the party iN that time we were suppose to be dancing It seemed we were having to much fun that day aFterwards my youngest brother came close to where we were dancing to see us dance but he was caring with him a cup of soda theN one of the grown ups gets up from its chair and bumps into him and he drops his cup of soda which splashed my cousin and me all Of our dress were wet dirty and sticky from the soda wE both stopped dancing and sat down on the ground and started to cry my aunt and my mon changed us to something else but later when we saw my brother we were so mad that we did not answer him when he asked us something or wanted to talk to us for that fact lAter on we were having fun again and talked to him back again fInally the video stopped iTs important that laughter gets people closer to someone because together they re having a great moment while laughing My cousin and i watching the video remembering our memories made us laugh from what happened to both of us We have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age We noticed how much we had changed right now from all the funny times we had enjoyed together We did realize that it was not my brothers fault for splashing us with soda lAughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united Obviously in different time in life you react in a different way but laughing in that moment or later on gets people together somEtimes in time feelings are different but laughing is important because you re sharing the moment of happiness with someone I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments,40
12598,I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and how they feel about you cAPS that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you caPS You make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person lauGhter is from the heart and soul caps THAT person tells You something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two feelings caps caps is a lot between two people caps is from the soul and down deep with in your body as my mon would say caps helps clear the mind and body but what i really think is that caps some one makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become you laugh about all kinds of things like jokes funny videos funny stories and more but the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh caps it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and have fun but my thought about caps is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and then caps it is funny then you start caps about it here is what my mon use to says to everyone is that caps you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body there are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that i think caps is just a feeling that people have you month tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all you could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start caps because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh there are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and a while i mean don't everyone need a laugh i tell my self almost everyday that caps i don't laugh then i did not clear my mind or soul but is it really About me no it is not CAPS you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really are not what YOU are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean i have been told funny things over the past few years but in a teenager what do you thiNK I will remember them all i am just like everyone else i will forget them over the years real easy i not all that smart but after i think about it for a few min i finally under stand the joke i know i am a caps but i have those days where i am saying what to people what are you talking aBout then they look at me and they just say wow you really arE CAps and i also have caps jokes aBout me and i really do not mind caps people tell caps jokes to me cause i am not affected at all i got use to it caps i heard my first caps joke i had to stop and think about iT FOr a few mind then after about an hour i realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me then i walk up to them and i was like caps i finally got that joke and then i was like what a really good joke caps you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone sPECIal either made you laugh or thEY Tickled you they might even tell you a very funny story about themSelves or someone thaT IS related to them caps you laugh is like your showing your feelings and caps to that person because caps you do laugh then it is just like wow you are really lost on what they where trying to tell you i will always tell my self caps i need a laugh or something to either call my friends up or just look in the mirror every morning because for some odd reason i think i am just really funny looking most people think that caps you look at your self and make funny faces in the mirror you will laugh non stop the reason i laugh is because i see or hear something really funny of just wanna laugh so much caps i have a good day or a good weEkend i laugh a lot,32
12599,laugHter is one of the many ways to share a memory It is also a key component to story telling it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows Laughter is having something in common it does not matter how much money you have or how old you are a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter inside jokes are daughters best friend from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone is face as a person i feel that it is my duty to make people laugh one example of this would be when i was seven years old and spending the night at my friend person is house we had just gotten done watching caps caps and were super hungry for lunch as it turns out person is big sister person was the only one home and she was not going to have anything to do with her baby sister so we were to fend for ourselves being young we did not want a boring old caps caps and caps sandwich we wanted to make numb cupcakes this might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems or so we thought in reality it was a disaster we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands which worked up until i brought the flower out from now on i will never think of flower in the same manner every time i open the jar of flower all i can think about is the mess person and i had made that day lets just say it was a disaster enough flower to successfully make numb cupcakes is approximately the whole bag as i was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl i slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup and the flower went everywhere person started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room as for me i was still in shock not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world now that i am a quite a bit older i don't think i could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly considering i would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up but as a little girl laughing was the only thing that mattered person couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white we started to play in the flower picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti when all of the sudden person came down the stairs took one look at the kitchen and started to yell caps and clean this up i was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess mon will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned person and i looked up at each other and back at the kitchen then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do all of the sudden i started laughing uncontrollably it felt as if i had no care in the world it turns out that person and i completely ignored person and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes we were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called snow i heard the slam of the front door as person is mon walked into the house it sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser because we did not clean up anything we in fact made the kitchen much worse we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all that month had been our biggest mistake as soon as organization is mon saw the kitchen we heard a scream person what is this slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and person starts explaining herself i choose to stay quiet because i had never gotten in trouBle by someonE that was not my own mon before when person is done telling her story her mon tells us to go downstairs both of us are on the verge of crying when all of the sudden person starts laughing once again i could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says you still have flower in your hair from this experience i have learned that sometimes laughing is the only thinG THAT will make You feel better even though i have moved away since this cupcake fiasco i know that if i ever talk to person again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this stORY,47

12601,laughter Laughter is a key thing to have in a relationship I once knew someone that had a great relationship because of laughter tHey didst think that they would still be together if they dent have any laughter in their relationship Laughter is the shortest distance between each other because if you done see this person but you can sill laugh with this person and have a great relationship with that other person Laughter between these two people laughed all the time and they got closer then ever even though they didst see each other all the time everyday I knew that there relationship wouldn't be alive anymore if they didst have there laughter it means that you are happy with that person lauGhing with someone that you care about also means that you can trust that person and you are being yourself around that person and you done have to act how you would normally with someone else that you done trust I had a boyfriend that i could laugh with all day everyday and that what kept our relationship together We laughed instead of talking because that says how we feel towards each other and we could just tell that we were happy with each other just by laughing sItting on the couch staring at each other in the eyes then we just started to laugh because we thought of something that we had said that made us bust up and just to laugh like crazy even with out saying any words Even though we had our fights we would still laugh at each other and things that made us laugh that one other said I would be really upset and sad and he would would just know what to say to make me laugh then i am happy because i know that he ares about me and cares if in happy or sad I am A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy that can make you laugh when your really upset or mad by just smiling or saying somethings that is goofy Even though he was mad at me he would still try to make me laugh or smile because that what i relationship is about If you cant smile or be happy with that person that you love then you shouldn't be with that person because you know that you wont be happy and you will always be depressed or just plan old mad at that person Laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways If you laugh with that person and you can be yourself that means that if you break up after if it didst work then that is probably a good sign that you guys will be great friends after I believe that laughter is something that makes two people closer and then it also is the shortest distance between two people if you done wanna talk like me and my boyfriend do we just sit or stand there and laugh because we knew that we could just laugh at each other and in sure people that we were weird or something but we didst even care so we would just laugh and laugh all day everyday all night long I think that if you a rent even in a relationship and you guys or gals are just great friends like me and my friend cAPS are then you can just laugh at everything that you think is funny and just have a great time you done have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone Laughing is great fort the goal,35
12602,Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny what is the point I have four friends that mean the world to me peRSON PersoN ORGANIZATION and capS CAps iS REal name is person but we all call her caps because how she acts person and i use to do almost everything together we were inseparable we went to school together we even ate our meals talking to each other person and i can make each other laugh no matter what the situation month be i remember when person and i had not been getting along like we usually do one day at around nine pm my phone rings it was person i did not know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us did not argue well i decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and i knew that she would have been there for me there was obviously a reason she called me right as i was about to say hello i could hear location crying i panicked person was not one to just cry because of something little i asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting i wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me the time before it had been organization organization our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguments that always ended in a laugh little did we know that the past two weeks person is caps had been house sitting he had not planned on returning home to his family as i listen to person tell me the news and how hurt she was my heart sank while she cried i cried her caps broke the news to her date time after we left for organization he will not be returning home because he has not been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce i knew exactly how person felt my parents got divorced when i was very young although it did not tear me apart like it did her it still effected me not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and in love was never easy on anyone person had not the slightest idea that her caps would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family she just kept telling me that she had to bring him home that she couldn't do this person AND Her caps were really cloSE She was daddy girl one hunDRED Percent i remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault all i could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay person began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her caps is mind i invited person over for the time to just hangout and maybe get things off her mind for awhile it couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her caps gone knowing he was not cOMING back so person came over we played guitar hero and eVERY time i messed up she woULD LAugh heAring person laugh again made me feel better about things because i knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her caps leaving without the laughter in that room i'm not sure me and person would have been able to ever be good friends again after all laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good frIends again so its very important to have laughter iN A RElaTionship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going downhill now person and i talk for endless hours or text about anything and everything and when we aRe not laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong,36

12608,iT was a cloudy daTE But nothing to be sad about when among friends This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together and they were heading home i Was among this group as a young capS who had known this group for three years tHree years before i Was shy but something changed that the Group was called ORGANIZATION thIs ORGANIZATION was for teenagers and even some collage students There were very few of us though iT was our last year as ORGANIZATION then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at tOgether we made that weekend be are best and last ORGANIZATION The boys were very comfortable around the girls so much in fact that they were going to make a deal with us tHe deal was that during the car ride if we rubbed their backs then they would rub our feet at capS the girls thought this to be a crazy idea but as time went on that foot rub seemed really good thrEe pairs were made with a boy and a caps IN Each the boyS sat in the second to last row in the car and the girls sat in the back i rubbed peRSON Is back but its okay out of all the girls there besides his sister i know person the best so i was perfect for the job this moment was a very giggly time for the girls and a very relaxed time for the boys while the boys were falling asleep the girls were laughing hysterically since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them this just caused more laughter and more alert boys after we had enough with the foot and back rubs then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster it was the date before date so our organization leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts the little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half we would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone i ended up giving both person and person candy hearts that said caps they were very confused but again it caused more laughter person accidentally gave one to person that said caps caps andrew got hearts multiple times that said caps caps caps once that was beginning to become boring then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining we would read the heart caps then give it to someone saying it was from someone else pyrene gave one to person saying it was from person that said caps numb caps whenever we had one that said caps then we would give it to person saying it was from location earlier she had said to him i thought you were caps for a moment there but numerous people thought she said i thought you were caps for a moment there caps we try to make it up to person for person by giving him caps candy hearts we ended that date with hugs goodbyes and laughter of retold inside jokes a few phone numbers were exchanged and a few that should have been were not the trip ended well and everyone felt just a little bit closer we could hug this person caps or we could get this persons phone number something in us changed that we could be a little closer in my experience i would say that laughter is only one element because to get laughter you need to love who your laughing with if i did not love the people i was in the car with then i would have not laughed with them they say laughter is the shortest distance between two people i don't believe this is true i think its love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown the statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause but in truth it is the effect love is the cause of laughter if laughter was the cause of love then this world would be doomed to never know Either without love there can be no laughter,40

12613,It was a day like any other i was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club but I knew that if I did not play caps best i would lose i entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there caps was caps had on a blue baseball cap a blue to shirt a pair of blue jeans and a pair of black shoes his hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if caps had not brushed it in years his skin was very pale i wondered how caps could go out in sun with out some way to block it the board was set up and ready caps was the clock the clock had an hour on each side i walked up to him caps did not even seem to notice me until i spoke caps caps gun beat me fast i know i'm gun loSE Caps just sat there staring at me like I had insulted him caps caps scoffed your the kid they think can beat me i gUess I never really thought about it I was unsure as to why that would mater but I was playing him caPS I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon capS PLease take caps SEAT caps we CAN begin the matches the coach called out caps we all knOW The rules the black player mONTH start the white capS CLocks no taLking caps i saID your name is what caps NAMe is caps i HIT the clock Expecting him to be like lightning and move I moved cAPS piece Bad move caPS called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not cAPS turn the coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons caps DID not even look like caps cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder when caps set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five i was already down on time and the game had not even really began caps picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square caps hit the clock like lightning that was wired caps moved the weakest piece on the board i had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it i looked over at the clock to see how i was doing on time it was terrible i had been sitting there for about ten minutes and i had not even moved one lousy piece caps i picked up caps kings pawn and moved up two squares hopping caps wouldn't do anything that could hurt caps in caps game i hit caps clock we sat there for what must have been half an hour caps i got up and went to the bathroom wheN i caME Back i checked on how the other caps were doing only one game was done it was person and a kid i did not know i asked who won it was the kid i did not know as odd as that was i had to get back to caps game caps still had not moved for a minute i thought caps was having a problem breathing caps let out a yawn and moved his kings knights pawn up two squares and hit the clock that was weird caps just did fools caps i did not think for a minute i picked up caps queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn i said caps caps in a loud voice caps started to laugh at first i was confused for i beat him then caps said i do caps with every one i play for the first time caps opening caps started to laugh again caps time i joined him we both were laughing because i beat him then caps said caps are the first one to see that they could win in the first two that surprised me i thought that caps won all the time when really caps had been giving people games and the did not know it we started to laugh again the coach came over and saw that i won caps said good job and walked away caps said caps is the start of a new beginning i can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me caps walked up to the coach and must have told him that caps wanted me on board one for now i'm on board one and caps NEW friend caps is there with me on board two,40
12614,Laughter is the shortest distance between two people Many people say that laughter is the key to life If you can't laugh then you are not a fun person to be around Many other people believe that laughter is a very important part of relationships that they are having iN my opinion I think that laughter is very important also It lightens the mood in awkward situations and laughter also just makes you and other people happy aNd i personally would rather be around a happy person than one that is not a fEw days ago my mon sister and I decided to go to the bowling alley in LOCATION We were all three invited to go along with about nuMB other women from the ORGANIZATION we attend we attend the ORGANIZATION We had all made reservations at CAPS CAPS at nuMB CAPS We arrived first and sat there and waited for about nUMB minutes Then finally we seen some of our friends walking in We ran over there to greet them and to show them where we were sitting Our friends started getting their bowling shoes from the counter and then they ventured over towards us Once all our friends got there we began to bowl we had a total of three CAPS for everyone mY mon sister and i Were all three at one lane and with us was two other friends the First game we bowled a normal game as usUal everyone was getting strikes except for me I was getting pretty discouraged So our second game around and we all decided to change the rules up a little bit This round we could not bowl like we normally do Each time it is our turn we have come up with a new way and new position of sending the ball down the lane After awhile everyone was running out of things to try so people started laying and sitting on bowling balls and then sending a different ball down the lane tHat was really hard Towards the end of the second game everyone was tired tHeir arms hurt and so did their fingers My last frame I got up and picked the ball I wanted to use i waited for the people in the CAPS next to me to get done with their turn and then I went up to bowl i got ready and brought my arm back before I flung the ball down the lane Just as I did that my fingers let go of the ball and i dropped it The whole side of the bowling alley I was on just busted up laughing i was so embarrassed My face was beet red iT was horrible Then on my next turn I brought ball back and then brought it forward and i literally threw it into the other lane i Fell to the floor laughing my head off it Was so funny that night by far was the best night I have had in quite a long while,40
12615,The cAPS we capS IN caps LAUGhteR is a usual caps useD IN many different ways to release tension to appreciate a funny joke or maybe just to express a giggly mood I find that laughter is the key to having a close relationship with people It could be because each persons laugh is personal and every time someone laughs they are not thinking about how they look or what they should say next to fill the awkward silence their guard is completely down for just an instant growing up with my father has proven this fact to me by having our relationship based off of laughing our problems or difficulties with one another away although i caps a good relationship with my caps the relationship with my caps has always been a silent and guarded one because we caps been unsuccessful in bringing humour to the relationship which proves to me the point that laughter and humour are two very important things in creating a bond between two people ever since i was a young girl my father and i caps always been very close and i caps begun to realize that whenever i speak of him to an adult or anyone really they will know him everyone always seems to know my caps it might be because of his humour or maybe because older women find him attractive or maybe because hers nice either way hers been popular his whole life also ever since have known my caps he has never been much of a serious type of guy he will make some sort of humorous comment or joke no matter the circumstance it does not matter if i'm sad or enraged under the spell of my adolescence and hormones my mood will completely change and because of this it has shown me the power of laughter the relationship between my caps and i however has always been a rocky one for several reasons i'm sure but one of them i believe is we were never capable of laughing together or enjoying ourselves see she comes from location location and in location things are done a bit differently laughing or fooling around for instance is considered being disrespectful or immature everyone is to act properly and children are to respect their elders so when my caps married her i introduced her to sarcasm and jokes i never got the reaction i was looking for and since there was never that connection through laughs and humour i felt guarded around her i caps never been able to feel like i can express myself around her i constantly feel judged and awkward and this has allowed me to see the effects of absence of laughter a human beings laughter is emotional and personal like crying it immediately allows you to feel happy sort of like a drug once you get someone to laugh you are allowing them to open up to you in a small way and not only are they opening up to you but by the good reaction you received you begin to create a connection with them if there is no laughter in a relationship with two people it tends to get awkward and neither person can feel comfortable opening up to each other since i am my caps daughter i tend to apply jokes in the same way he does when there is tension when someones upset and i want to immediately solve the problem i make them laugh someone once said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people how i interpret this quote is that laughter is the one caps everyone enjoys doing it can either build or keep relationships going its the one caps we will always caPs in caps so cimon guys laugh a lITTLe,45

12619,I met my best friend pERSON when we were in kindergarten At the time we were both shy and we looked to one another for comfort Little did we know the acquaintances we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of good memories and plenty of laughter laSt datE my family took a trip to my grandparents house in location location my grandparents usually only used the house once a year in the date so while they were home in location my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house both of my siblings are in their twenties and are busy with college so my parents invited person to attend we were so excited for this was our first time to location together person and i had many activities planned and i couldn't wait to sHOW HER arouND ORGANizaTion location person the only downside of the trip was that we wOULD be driving we would be in the CAR FOR about numb hours i had known this since we used to go to organization a lot when i was little so i brought along a notebook that we could draw in and write in by the time we got to organization that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that person and i had quoted each other for person and i have an odd kind of humour we think everything is funny when were together it can Be the most ridiculous thing and we will burst out laughing and no one will know why finally a good numb hours later we arrived in LOCATIon it was latE though and we had to unpack therefore i wouldn't be showing person around until the next day that did not mean our night was nOT EXCITing in the baCKYARD of thE house there is a pool house and in order to keep someone at the home when no one is there my grandparents rent out the pool house my parents had known that a man named caps lived in the pool house none of us had met him only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he attended college in organization that night my mon asked me to go get my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready it was dark outside so i made person come with me when we got outside we saw my dad had introduced himself to caps caps looked exactly how i imagined him he had on red shorts no shoes and a peach coloured to shirt he had sandy blond hair and was pretty scruffy he looked like a big beach bum caps quickly made his way over to me and person and introduced himself he was pretty nice and very goofy throughout our whole conversation person and I couldn't keep straight faces caps SAID THAT HE had TO GO So hE WANTed tO teach us a handshake that he made up he stuck his hand out and curled his index ring and middle finger so that they were in towards his palm and the only remaining fingers sticking out were his pinky and thumb he gestured us to do the same thing we all did as he told us and stuck our hands in the enter of where we were standing and he tapped his pinky and thumb against our pinkies and thumbs he said good evening and ran back to the pool house it was very odd but so FUnny that My dad person and i still do this on occasion the next day i took person downtown and showed her arOUND WHEN WE were on our Way back we stopped inside a craft store that i nor person had ever been in when we walked in it looked like any other average craft store But as we explored a liTTLE MORE WE noticed there was a huge section of arm or and helmets that caps soldiers wore us being big dorks decided that we had to put them on so we put on the helmets and arm or and stood by the windows in the front shop and waved at people the ladies working in the craft shop were laughing at us and it had us laughing at ourselves too we fell down from laughing so hard AT THis poiNt the people who were working WERE not laUghing anymore they were mad that we had fallen while wearing the arm or they came over and told us to take it off and that we needed to leave we did what they told us to do by the end of the trip we had made so many memories and we couldn't wait to return the following year in my opinion laughter is very important in relationships it is healthy and it means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you feel this date person and i will be returning to location person and are looking forward to many new memories and laugHs that we will share,39
12620,iN the daTE On the month of date I experienced laughter on a grand scale iF i recall the memories correctly the event began on the day of cAPS when my family gathered for a celebration the Day began normally as any caps WHEN all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast and i lobbyiNg around careless and oblivious to the world around me Even so I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity I just enjoyed pEople my family looked upon me with confused eyes bewildered by my actions and expressions kept distance from me tHough i continued i still felt a sense of worry for if i Had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess For that very day i noticed a different side to me a side that I wish would vanish from my being Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself see the sane person I use to acknowledge The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers I attempted to apologize for my actions aLthough the first attempt seemed to startle them seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews sO onward i continued in my life again oblivious to my surroundings yet it differed in my earlier life I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life thIs is when i Noticed another person burrowed into my soul my alter ego coming to light and possessing my body this other being this alter ego I gave the name pERSON and with these new emotions that came with i aCcomplished great feats Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance He gives strength to me by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me I view him as not another person so to say however as another part of my being Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise I do believe that we all have this person this personality within us empowering us to drive forth and never look back End,35
12621,Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People A thing we have done since birth is laugh Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence it is something that relieves awkward situations brings people together and makes life a little bit easier Laughter is something that everyone shares in common Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations brought me close to someone and just made life more enjoyable I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I did not know anyone I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them There was one thing I knew about them though It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there but I ignored them and just kept working hard Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just did not feel right I still felt like I did not belong there It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little but i still felt a little uncomfortable After the last practice it was time to announce the teams I was really nervous cause what if I did not make it oR what if i did but everyone hated me on the team He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name I was so excited but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me i then told them how i did not really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone and i said no not really they did not try talking to me so I thought why should I mY mon then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there I thought about it and realized I really had not I ignored them as much as they ignored me i also was not myself because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named PERSON It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time The rest of the practice went great The awkward moments faded away into laughter We all worked hard and joked around with each other laughed and I really felt like we were bonding tHey laughter had brought us together All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it was not like that at all Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same I believe that day that laughter brought our team together I will never forget that day It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship getting to know someone and how well it brings people together That season of volleyball I made many new friends I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together just because you known someone for a while does not mean the fun and laughter has to fade away because I believe it should get stronger Whenever I am meeting new people I always try to break the ice and lighten up the mood with something funny because I think that a big point in our lives is to be happy have fun and all laugh together That is exactly what I plan to do,42

12629,hAve caPS ever been in that mood were cAPS just can not stop laughing and no matter what capS just can't stop That is the problem my good friend peRSON PersoN AND i have when we are together Most of the time we are just talking about random things and we both find it hilarious Luckily for the teachers we only have two classes together In both of those classes we sit next to each other though sO the teachers did not luck out too much Just the other day in caPS Caps we were allowed to move are seats around and have that be our new spot in the class The girl that was sitting next to me moved and sat next to pERSON now ORGANIZATION does not like this girl very much so I spoke up and said peRSON Caps can sit next to me persON grabbed her stuff in an unusually quick manner and came and sat next to me tHe funny thing was when she sat down she said capS SAved my life for somE reason person and I just started laughing non stop We couldn't control it To be honest it was not that funny i guess it was just in the way she said i saved her life i'm glad person Sits next to me in caps caps with out her it would be so boring in caps we sit next to each other and we have a good time our caps class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by Then person and i sit next to each other and when we are taking notes person and i pass notes back and forth to each other she and i talk about everything from the predicaments a teenage girl runs into in high school to boys and parents i can pretty much tell her everything and that is a good friend over the years person and i have become closer and closer friends last year she and i had at least three or four classes together so we have been in classes together previously person and i have become more acquainted and more open with things i tell her everything and she tells me everything one reason why i think weave become good friends is because she and i find the same things funny we have the same interests in things she is a good friend and I'm glad sHEDS My friend laughter is tHE ShorTEST diStance between two peoPle I AM going to definitely have to agree with that,31
12630,i my name is capS I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share cAPS honEstly i dEpend on a good laugh during my day Without laughter life would never be the same for me Laughing has brought me to who I am today nOt only has caPS made me the person I am but cAPS has brought me to all my friends and the people I love For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend pERSON persoN and I are just like any other couple We have fun do stuff together and we argue thE worst part is when we fight just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times Our hard times all start when we wake up When i wake up its still really dark outside tHe smell of fresh tiME air makes me feel refreshed I always feel like the happiest girl in the world A little while after i wake up i text pERSON good timE ANd we usually always talk through out the tIME Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school wHen i see him i am happy and my toes curl We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything just life At this point he thinks its time to say something funny sO he does he will make fun of how i look what i am wearing and what i say he does not find caps hurtful but to me caps is many times i might even say something mean back which does not help caps just makes caps worse not long goes by maybe a few seconds and we start to fight he does not understand he has hurt me or he does not care person tells me he has done nothing wrong so i try to explain caps and he does not listen i just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that is fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things enough has gone through my mind so i cry and he gives me a dumbness look this just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse there is yelling and screaming with tears and mean rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess i usually storm of in the middle caps cause i cant take anymore finally time goes by and we have not talked all day we don't have aNYTHing to say to each other eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood i will do anything to see a smile on his face even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for caps to be like thiS ANymore Of course he smiles just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh person will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no caps does not matter to him he apologizes and explains a couple things to me i feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight so we work caps out now you can SEE if i did not have laughter i might be depressed without laughter things would be harder and more complicated but a good laugh or a simple joke caN EAse things And make them a lot better in life i just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day if caps can change your day in such a big way than caps can change your life iN a major way things month come across as hard of rough when i look back on my life and see what caps has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and caps brought me back uP again,36

12633,Allot of people say that laughter is a big part of any relationship and i agree allot of people don't always laugh and in every relationship laughter is a big component to make someones day of the greatest day they have ever had There is always someone who is having a bad time in school or at home or any other place and when you see someone like that you should always cheer them up like saying something nice or just even saying something like hope you have a good day dATE give them a smile so that can put there bad thing that is avoiding them from laughing aside and you have just made there day by sharing your smile and laughter with them Allot of people need someone they can go to when they are going through a very hard situation or problem they are going through that they cant go through it alone in there home or even at school and they need someone they can talk to and share there feelings with a shoulder they can cry on and that always makes someone feel good letting all that pain and inner self out to others we all need to make someone who is going through a hard time smile and laugh and that is always something very healthy in a relationship and it is a way to offer that person who is in pain or sad have a healing This reminds me of a true story i know because i was there One time there was a girl who i had in my elementary school she was a very happy girl she shared her laughter and happiness with others she was someone anyone could go to when they had a problem or they just needed someone to talk to she was one of the nicest girl in school everyone liked her and she tended to always show love and respect to others it always seemed as if her life was so perfect she had no worries she was just full of joy and she was only child in her family so of course her parents would always give her what she wanted or at least that is what we all thought It had been a dATE and we it came to be dATE and we were all in school except this girl she never missed a day of school so it was very strange for her not to be there but just as every other person she must have been sick so that is what we thought except she missed another day and then another and another so i was starting to think she had moved away and she was probably never coming back but the next week after that she showed up i was very happy to see her i had missed that girl except there was something very different about her she was not the same she was not laughing or smiling anymore she had lost that sparkle that made her so different i thought to myself what is wrong with her i finally found out that she had been gone because her mon had past away i was so sad i did not know what to say she was just so happy and from one day to another she did not have her mon anymore i thought i have both of my parents and she does not i should share the happiness she had share with me and others right back to her and be there for her now that she was gong through the hardest time of her life tHat is why being happy and sharing your happiness with others always is the greatest thing you can do for someone because you never know what kind of things there going through and they need someone to make them smile and laugh,37

12653,Ever since I was born laughter has been a big part of my life without it I would be a very boring and grumpy person Even tough I have experienced many moments full of laughter one specific moment always comes to mind About a year ago my mon and I went on a trip down to lOCATION to visit her family It was the first time we had been there in over twelve years because my mon and I could not go visit them do to immigration problems After all toughs years had past by my mon and I managed to get our legal residency in the united states As soon as we got the residency we were free and could go visit her family without having to come back illegally wHen my mon and i got to the airport in loCATION My mon started crying because she was full of emotions for the first time in twelve years she was going to see her mon dad brothers and sisters As soon as we had gone trough all the airport security and baggage claim we made our way out to the exit where my grandpa had agreed to pick us up wHen we got outside the airport a small little red ORGANIZATION started getting closer and closer driving towards my mon and I tHe car was no further then forty feet away when my mon suddenly dropped her luggage and started running toward the small red car I had no idea who the elderly person driving the car was When the car parked an aged man stepped out of the vehicle and gave my mon one of the longest and most emotional hugs I had ever experienced in my entire life they must of been hugging for at least fifteen minutes just crying on each others shoulders wHen they had finished hugging my mon calls out my name and I start walking toward her wHen i was face to face with my mon and the older man my mon tells me that the man was my grandfather then she looks at her dad and tells him to meet his grandson For the first time in a very long time I had a grandfather I stood in shock for a while and so did he He was amazed of how big and how much I had changed in toughs long twelve years that he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me wHen i reached out to hug him he griped me hard and did not let go he told me that this day had been the happiest day of his life me and my grandpa started loading the luggage into his car so we could head home to meet the rest of my family When we got done loading everything into the car we headed home The long ride home was a bit weird and uncomfortable because there was not much talk in the car It was about a fifty minute ride home when we reached our destination in a small little town out of the lOCATION called tex coco It was a nice little clean town with a lot of small stores and lots of two story middle class houses the streets full of cars and people walking or on bicycles very different to what I was used to back in the united states When we got to our house there was a group of about twenty people that were family and friends outside the gate waiting for us When we were done seedling in and got done meeting all our relatives we got together and had a family dinner One of my uncles really stood out because he was really funny and always was acting like a clown he was the one that set the mood in the house or wherever he went As days past by I was getting more and more comfortable with the people around me and started having fun About two weeks past and my uncle cAPS invited me to one of his stand up comedy shows that day I experienced more laughter then ever before his jokes where original and true In conclusion laughter is one of the elements to life without I could not be happy,33
12654,Its my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try out softball After thinking about it I joined and I fell in love with this sport I am not that good but like they say practice makes perfect We all laugh and have a good time and everyone likes everyone and its fun to be apart of a team that is always laughing and having a great time together This is about a time when my friends and I started laughing so hard we almost started cried and now its one of our little joke between all of us girls Once my friends and I were out catching pop fly a and it was my turn to go catch the ball I went out there skipping and just being my normal weird self They hit the ball and it started to come toward me and I went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt Everyone including me started laugh because I fell in the mud and got all dirty About ten minutes later we all were standing there and talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone is day then i saw some mud on the ground and i wanted to roll in it but did not want to just lay down and start rolling in mud so i asked my friend person to push me into the mud so i could fall in and roll in it after she pushed me into the mud i got up and started laughing my head off my knees were covered in mud and so was my butt and legs they all started to say who shied on you because we are not aloud to curse so we made something else to replace it now when i walk in the hall ways and see someone from the softball team we both just start laughing and say who shied on you in the middle of what ever we are doing right then this is the first year i have ever played a sport in high school and i am glad i did it because i am having so much fun when it ends in a few months i am going to be really upset all these girls and i have became so close in the last numb weeks that they are like family to me now most of us use to just know each other and not really were friends and never talked at all but now we all do we love to do silly things like sing in the locker room randomly or make the most dumbest jokes ever but we all have fun and we don't care We haVe had lots of laughs and many moRe to come this season like when we have games on the buses or just even at practice we have an amazing coUch that makes us laugh anD MAkes jokes everyday this season should be interesting With all of us because we all like to laugh and make joke and sing and just have a great time with each otheR and that is all that Matters to make a good softball team and a great seasOn,40
12655,The Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a major part of my life Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are great because i can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down When a person laughs it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness wHen you laugh the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh nothing else laughter in many cases has brought people from an absolute low self esteem to a high self esteem in a very short amount of time An example in where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends oNe of my good friends seemed to be really down and did not want to talk about what was going on with anyone With him not telling anyone what was wrong it kind of leaves you guessing what could have happened After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends which included me me and two other people that were friends with me and him decided to go golfing which was a new hobby of ours it waS that day that he told us how his mon was cheating on his dad for over a year and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places and was over drinking By him just being around his friends laughing and having a good time he found himself focusing on other things other than what was going wrong in his life Even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems even when there seems that nothing will go right in your life something always will you just have to give it time The moral of the story that i have just told is that no matter how sad you feel laughter can always help ease the pain Even laughing about a bad situation could help you to feel better,40
12656,Laughter is huge part of everyone is life its used to express several different emotions its used to bridge the gap between people and break the awkward barrier people laugh at their own mistakes which show others that they too make mistakes some people can communicate through laughter and know what the other is feeling for instance one time while i was on a long car ride and very bored and about to fall asleep so out of no where i began laughing with my friend and laughing different ways and carried on a whole conversation just with laughter laughing can bring others together by sharing common interests everyone laughs i laugh more than others i'm sure oF it laughter is a huge part of my life honestly with out it my life would be boring and depressing i laugh so much sometimes that my side and stomach hurts so bad i also make a lot of mistakes and am very clumsy so i get laughed at a lot my family is a very close and hilarious family we make a lot of mistakes constantly everyday for my great grandmas date we were planning a surprise party while we were planning it my grandma kept getting suspicious and asking what we were doing so we kept telling her that we were going to get her a stripper for her date so we managed to talk my uncle bobby into being a stripper and climbing out of a box and so he did and it ended up scaring my grandma until this day we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time everyday my aunt acts in a Ridiculous and funny way and so most of the time i laugh at her she is alwAys dancing at music on commercials or singing opera my great grandma always eats fOods that make her pass gas and its hilarious because sometimes she does not even realize that she is doing it my gReat grandma also lIkes to dance and it also hilarious because the dance moves that she knows are far difFerent then the ones today i believe that with out laughter my family would not be as close as we are with out laughter i would not be as close to my friends you can bond over laughter it sometimes forces you to ask questions and get to know people in other ways you would not it makes you comfortable around people and able to share things and act silly and not worry about your appearance laughter can also change your emotion from mad to happy in an instance for example i was riding dirt bikes with my younger cousin and he decided that he wanted to go through this swamp with his bike i told him it was not very wise because i knew it was not possible for him to go through there with out getting stuck and yet he tried it anyway so as i assumed he got the bike stuck and since i was the only one with him i had to help him get the bike unstuck it took forever for uS to get the bike out as SOOn as we did he tried to drive through again and got it stuck yet another time i was very upset with my cousin but as i was getting ready to yell and leave him he fell in the mud head first and it instantly chanGed my mood even still today i laugh about the matter even though i did not think it was very funny at the time even though laughter is good it cAn also be bad caps laughing at others while they are hurt and crying or laughing at stupid ignorant pranks or even laughing at people while they are making bad decIsions decisions caps drinking drunk people are funny but the fact of being drunk or drinking at all is not you can actually influence people to Make bad decisions by laughing at them laughing at them makes them think that its caps to do what theY are doing because it is making others laugh so lAUGHter is healthy but it is also unhealthy in a way,41
12657,So my friends and i got into a heated discussion on how we need to keep things to our selves cause one of my friends told people some personal things about us He caused us allot of problems in school and around town CAPS he started to lie to us one of my other friends lost it and went after him and tackled him down told him to quite lying By the time he let him up and we all got back in are seats he started to spill his guts to us he told us some rulers he started about us and some other things he did we kinda all lost it So we calmed down a little then took turns talking to him after my two friends talked it was my turn i was talking to him and he kept interrupting me finally i got mad and i graded something off the floor to throw at him don't git me wrong not to hurt in to stop him from interrupting me i reached down graded something soft without looking picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started to point and laugh i stored turned my head to look at what was in my hand now remember it was an intense conversation you could cut the tension with a life for him to start laughing and everyone join in i didst want to know but i turned my head looked and fell over laughing it was a stuffed fairy i picked up off his floor i did through it at him but playfully we all finally stored laughing and sat back down i believe that it calmed us down enough to help explain and make things better for him and all of us the moral of the story is even though your mad something will always make you smile and make your day Better,30
12658,Every fibre of my being was urging me to talk to her but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do cAPS theN she glanced at me Just for a second but enough to gather information about me enOugh to tell that i Was not just looking around the room vacantly but i was focusing on her dark brown eyes and hers only i sheepishly flickered my eyes away quickly counselling myself why did you keep looking at her you knew that she was going to notice but somehow i knew i wanted her to i wanted her to look back at me i did not feeling her gaze upon me anymore even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact i darted my eyes in her direction again this time she was looking at me first and i fell into her sight i did not know what to do about this i have not been in this situation before caps girl has ever beaten me to first glance she smiled a cute little smile have noticed you noticing me i don't see why you need to hide it i have my eye on you all i could do was focus on not looking like a moron i willed myself to smile but only slightly enough to let her know i saw her smile and it was at me there was person smiling at me giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her then date came the ice rink in location was about numb minutes away which seemed short because of the numb friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back we drove up and parked next to the rink as we stepped out of my momus minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn probably never cleaned ice skates absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors one by one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice making sure we did not look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us when we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink every once in a while wed race each other for a lap around the rink but besides that we just talked about caps of caps caps caps and the various other Games that held our interest but as usual that conversAtion turned into a debate about over powered classes one side complaining that they can never win against that class the other saying that its very easy to destroy them with a simple trick i proceeded to daze off out of the fight looking around the rink watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants then i saw her again her hair was the first thing that caught my eye it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a date is breeze then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed just as beautiful as before she was not having the hardest time skating but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side lose her balance but was able to regain her composure within a second or two i smiled as she looked around checking if anyone had seen her little mishap caps the sniper is caps location you don't know what you re talking about my friends sneered at one another i had caps interest in being pulled into this argument as i sped up away from my friends and weaved my way through the crowd i eased my way towards person as i approached her i was running one liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her i noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her and i smiled at what i could do to be able to engage her as she began to stumble i had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her right when she was about to fall over i sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards but she was too far gone she tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice as the commotion seized she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness but all she noticed was my hysterical laughing all she could do was laugh along,42

12664,Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying tHere are many things that can cause people to laugh anD once you start laughing you can't stop Laughter is caused by something that is humorous so its mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun aNd it usually depends on who you are with where you are and in what kind of situation you re in before you can actually start laughing Kind of like the time when I was in lOCATION baking a pie with my cAPS capS It was a nice warm evening in lOCATION and I was making a pie with my cAPS capS We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my cAPS points out there is no more sugar She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar sO i went and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no tables on them I think its the the jar on the left she said I grab the jar on the left side without another word Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another my caPS and I go and get the pie to serve to the family They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it iMmediately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in there mouths suDdenly my locATION makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting tHen my caPS Caps goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it Luckily enough it was the salt jar Then out of no where everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened It was the most fun I had that evening nobody could stop laughing cLearly the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget and i'll probably never happen again aNd after all that happen with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh tHis shows that the three causes of laughter is real fiRst i wAs with my caps SECondLy i was iN my location Is house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakably hilarious And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed iF you are a person who says that they be never laughed then you are a liar and a hypocrite being able to laugh is good for you and your health it gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you Breathe easier and its a lot of fun so if you ever notice that you have not laughed stop immediately and take the time to have a laugh,43

12671,Every dATE my family friends and I pack up for an exciting trip to ORGANIZATION we always take our cAPS runner and boat along with us we rEnt a large cabin that is right on the water side We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degrees so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water it is located over the pass about an hour from caps their are many fun activities to do at organization like caps kayaking aqua cycling bike riding boating and lots more this was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and i was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather then my parents who go very slow and they don't make it that much fun he would always put one of us on the caps runneR to caps the flag when one of us fell off and one of us would be on the tube one time he took me and my friend person out it was in the latter afternoon and that is when the water gets rough and choppy first person was on the tube and i was flagging on the back of the caps runner with my brother he would have us going around in circles at ABOUt nUmb mph she ended up flying off right away once person got up on the caps runner i hopped on the the tube and i told my brother i was ready we would do thumbs up to go faster thumbs down to slow down and caps your arms around like your crazy to stop he started going and i had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going he started going really fast and i was flying every which way going in circles every time i would hit a caps i would get whip flash i put my thumb down to go slower and he did not slow down he kept going faster and faster then i waved my arms around to make him stop person was the one watching me and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that i wanted to keep going faster finally i did about two back flips into the water i hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off it hurt so bad it took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when i took a huge gasp of air i was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive over and pick me up something did not feel right i did not have my bikini bottoms on any more i started panicking and told my brother not to come over i looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen i told my brother and he called my dad my dad and mon were on there way to bring me a pair of shorts because their was no way i was getting out of the water with no shorts on i had a blast at ORGANIZATION and i have a great story that i will be telling for the rest of my life i cant wait to go back neXT Year and i know that i will be bringing an super tight shorts to go tubing in,40
12672,whEn you laugh what are you thinking about wHo are you with whAt are you doing when you were three you laughed because someone went caps a BOO and they contorted their face When you were thirteen you laughed because someone looked different and was not wearing clothes that were in by the time your twenty three you laugh with your friends because your friend is drunk and doing something stupid in the middle of the party but when you find yourself at thirty three your laughing while your husband is wrestling your five year old well about three years back my brother and i finally figured out how to have a relationship the person family has always been complicated when we tell people how we are related their response is always caps what start over so we try to avoid the topic my brother person has lived in location his whole life with his mother and step caps so neither our caps or i really had a close relationship with him although it was not our dads fault we only saw person maybe twice a year in those two times a year person and my sister person would always pick on me hide from me and laugh at me because i couldn't do what they could i used to hatE it when he was coming down because i knew i would spend most of that time crying and getting iN trouble for things i did not do when three kids grow up together they find that they like each other better when they get along my brother was not so mean to me anymore and he figured out that we were on the same side against the common enemy caps our relationship has always grown around laughter we get along because we are able to make jokes about one another everyday and know that it meanS nothing its our way of showing we care about each other sometimes we laugh at other people and sometimes we laugh at ourselves now that my brothEr is OFF At college we actually miss each other And the key to our relationship is the laughter we share when my broTHER fouNd thaT he actually liked me he taught me everything about video games and Helped me we WERE not only on the same team in the video gaME BUT Also in real life summer date my brother and I Were sitting at home BORed beCause caps was at work and person did not haVe a car in location we decided to play all the video games at least once throughout that endless day that challenge did not last long because the first and last game we played that day was caps numb we started off just figuring out how it worked and where to go and we fought about it for a good hour then we started playing just to see who is team won we started making jokes about each others players and we gave all the bad players mean really weird names we laughed through the whole game then to make things more interesting we got into making our own characters and building a fantasy draft person being a guy came up with the grossest names and made the players look either really scary or really funny he stacked their stats so they had an overall team average of percent in everything i being a girl made all my guys really hot and muscular with funny names and only stacked their stats to what i thought was reasonable depending on their good looks so my team average was only percent from the moment of the tip to the the moment we looked at the final stats for the game we were laughing every time the announcer said one of our players names in that basketball context it was so wrong but so funny caps caps for two when both teams made every shot and then by some chance somebody missed one we made so many comments and jokes by the time caps had gotten home he thought something was wrong because we were crying so hard from laughing that our tan carpet had turned brown even through dinner when we had calmed down person would say something only i would know what it meant and we would just burst out laughing and caps would look at us with a dumbfounded expression looking back i wouldn't trade anything for that day nOW PERson and i sometimes brIng up that day when we starT PLAYing a sports game OR WEre just talking on the phone we laugh and use context to Make fun of each other a you could say its not a very normal relationship but that is how we know we love each other because truth is i don't even like viDeo games i only ever play a video game when he wants to so since that daY we have become closer we don't fighT and we actually stand up for each other so who ever said laughter is the shortest distanCe between to people is right,40

12674,I think that laughter is a very important part of life and sometimes it helps people when there down One time I was with my cousin and she was having a bad day she was stressed upset and she did not know what to do so she came over and she got real emotional and I told her it was okay to cry Then after a while when she calmed down I told her that life was not always going to be easy that a lot of people said life was life a box a chocolate you just gotta eat nUMB at a time some moNTH Be sweet and the others might not be so good but I told her that life was more like a jar of jalapenos what you do now mONTH burn your butt tomorrow and she just laughed and right then and there she smiled and laughed so I knew she was going to be okay she just needed some time to cool off and be okay and then after all that she had a good day she stayed the tIME and we just watched movies and listened to music and that is why i think its good to laugh and besides you lose calories that way a a,26

12676,so one time my friends chad justin and i ding dong ditched this old man the reason we did this is because we would walk by his house everyday and he would turn on his sprinkler and this annoying alarm thing so at like nine or ten at night we walked over to his house banged on his door and ran it was so funny cut when we got back from running we went to our friend taylor house and we where sitting in the garage just basking in the glory of what we had just accomplished about ten seconds later we heard banging on the garage door at first we where kinda startled so we ran into taylor room and that when it happen the funniest shit ever the old mad just started charming and banging on the door then he yelled come out boys what are you afraid of and we just crack up in laughter well he totally knew we where in there so he went to the front door and started banging on that waking up taylor mon we we ended up going out and talking to the guy and he said he called the cops cause he said it happened all the time and we denied it was us but it totally was so we couldn't help but laugh in his ugly face he seriously looked like a turtle crossed with an eighty year old rapes he had liver spots on his face and a terrible grey com over that want fooling anyone by the time the cops showed up the guy was long gone and we told the cop he was senile and didst know what the hell he was talking about so we got off scot free it was funny and awesome,30
12677,What exactly is laughter Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful aCcording to peRSON Is caps laughter is a cause of merriment in other words a light hearted fun spirit laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself an example of laughter being important in relationships is when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct it had been almost two years exactly since her and i have not spoken i thought nothing would brings us together until one day when i was at the store and we ran into each other we just looked at one another and just started laughing right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless and not worth talking about to be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and i would have never been reunited when you meet new people whats the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you you usually tell jokes or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them this is where laughter ties into life physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual when you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common i guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together there is no possible way of getting around it another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality what do you most often do in this type of situation either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes if this does not work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality learning how to handle life can become very stressful also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge a friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in she was very stressed out and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on caps did not know what to do no money was coming in yet and she couldn't fIND an apartment she just was a mess untiL one day she told me that she revived a calL from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass caps rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life lIfers to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst caps and there caps realized that what her grandma had said was true you can't live through life in a drag just have to get up and take it caps was very devastated about her grandmas lost but caps again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did she did not feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis she will always love her grandma when you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve individuals learn in many other ways or some Just don't learn at all for example caps learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well other people learn form meeting new people and just having fun with life or LIKe me i learneD THe hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty headed argument laughter comes in different shapes and sizes we as human beings have to approach it whEther its an argument or learning it as it comes one way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it its not a scary thing the benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time laughter is a positive thing and people shouldn't ignore it its a good stress reliever as well laughter is a cause of merriment a light hearted FUN spirit laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big rOLE in life itself,40

12687,Laughter is one of the most impotent things in life to have around even if from a simple joke to something that was unbelievable that hap end to make a grate event in time to share on in history of family members This helps you threw hard times or just makes somebody day better for them and puts a smile on there face or gives them a joke to say to somebody else to continue a chain of laughter thew people sOmetimes it can be the most embarrassing thing that people remember about a but in the end the other person that laughs at you for your indecent probably did something like that a long time a go so in the end there laughing at them selves to and don't even realize it I remember on my fifteenth birthday my grandma toke the hole family out to dinner at a chines restaurant It was quiet except for the adults discussing what they should order form the family meals I was siting by me sister looking at a menu just to see what they had to drink well her mined was on other things because out of no were all a heard was they have no fri ken chicken Every one busted up laughing at her even the waitresses son that was standing behind the both and his mother It made every ones day because it was not the best of days at the time but a could tell she was embarrassed but laughed at her self to her comment to the table was i thought i said it in my head i looked at here and said no a did not so she just shrugged about it to this day when ever we go to a chines restaurant my mon looks at here and says they got your fri ken chicken so she looks at here and says will that ever die we all looked at here and said no its going to be passed down to your children they'll here about there mothers fri ken chicken day it was that bad of a indecent that she gets up set that it wont go away but it still gives every one else a laugh even though it was so long ago that it happened are parents joke that its going to be her wedding toast it went kinda like this as long as you give her her fri ken chicken you caps will last forever it was not the nicest of comments to be said about that day but it was still funny to the rest of us this is something that will last in the family for years to come and hopefully will be passed down in the generations to come even if she does not want it to be just think in time ens ted of us telling every one about the incident she will tell them her self and just laugh about it because it was just that much of an out off nowhere thing to happen we still pick on her about it and many other things she says out loud with out noticing she says them but those are story is for another time and day you never know what could happen just remember to laugh its true what they say its healthy for you so make the best of some of the worst days possible so if your having a not so good of a day a never know what could happen to give a a smile and a laugh even if your the one that makes every one laugh so just think of something that makes a laugh and tell the people that are special in your life about it to give them a laugh and make there day a little better then most even if its one of the most embarrassing events to happen to you in your life time when we all were little and crying that was always the cure for some of the worst things even though a grow up it docent mean a cant laugh or that it means different things then it used to when your down a need to laugh to feel better about your self don't let people put you down,30
12688,i think that laughter is a key element to any lasting relationship because if you didst have laughter then that would be one boring relationship lEt me share with you a personal story of my own I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is cAPS we First met here at school and then he transferred and moved away then a few months ago he added me on facebook and we started talking again At the time we had started talking he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again he realized that she was not the one for him anymore iT was rough for him to break up with her but he did it and i am proud of him because she treated him very bad in the beginning of our relationship we were both really shy and didst talk much but the more and more that we hang out the more we start talking We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts Every time i see him i get really nervous and it almost seems as if my heart skips a beat Whenever we are walking down a street i cannot help but to smile aNd when we lay on the coach and watch movies i can't help but to laugh when he tickles me wE laugh at each other all the time wether its when one of us makes a mistake or what not I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong Every time he leaves i cannot wait to see him again lAughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it i feel like it would be a really being and if it is boring than you wouldn't want to spend time with one another I personally think that every moment with your significant other should be fully taken advantage of,40
12689,Everyone in life has siblings that they grew up with and that they love unconditionally but for some of us we did not know our siblings until later in life I myself was one of those people but with a slight difference than some others I had what I like to call a pERSON who in actuality in my biological father Up until I was seven years old I thought that my dad pERSON was my quote on quote real dad but one evening I heard my mother down stairs yelling at someone on the phone mY mon was yelling at this unknown figure about child support and signing over his rights to my dad I had no idea that who she was talking about was me and in fact the one on the other dATE of the line was my biological father The moment I heard your son deserves better than this I ran upstairs to my room and began to weep because I thought that pERSON was my dad but now this new figure in my life is claiming to be mY mon had heard me run up the stairs and came to tell me the story of what was really going on As it had turned out my biological father had rights to my last name and unless he signed these over to my dad my mon would take him to court and force him to pay the thousands he owed her for child is support During this little story that she was unveiling I had learned that I have other siblings out there in the world Over the next eight years of my life I would spend countless hours running through old phone numbers and email addresses trying to find my other siblings iT was not up until my freshman year that I met a guy who went to my school and was in the same grade as me named peRSON He quickly became one of my good friends and we hung out every other dATE On one occasion that he was at my house playing video games with me he chanced upon a question of what my last name was I thought to myself that this was a peculiar question but in the dATE i Told him All of the sudden a smile crept across his face and he asked if I had a biological father named cAPS My mind started to reel over this sudden question peRSON started to explain to me that he was half brother to my sister cAPS who was one of the siblings that I had been searching for Almost before I cAPS think to ask the question of how he had called my sister and explained to her he had found her brother aS it had turned out she had been looking for me just as hard as I was looking for her peRSON asked her if she would like to meet me and I heard a high pitched squeal of joy from my sister saying yes on the phone I to was overjoyed at the thought but I had no idea of how awkward it would be to finally meet her the next dATE on The date THAt i met my sister caps moN had come to pick me up to take me to her house As we were driving so many thought were racing through my head that I thought I would puke in the car When we finally arrived at her house pERSON who is capS MOn urged me out of the car and into the house where my sister that I realized looked almost the same as me was sitting on the couch looking just as nervous as I was During the next four long nerve racking hours my sister and i played nuMB questions with each other to get to know one another After doing this we were more comfortable with each other and she looked a lot more accepting that I was truly her older brother By the dATE we were telling jokes and laughing hysterically We realized that we even had the same obnoxious laugh that every one hated and that to made us hit the floor laughing at one point in time her mon had to tell us to quiet down because we were going to wake the baby if we did not and by the dATE of the datE we had connected with each other so much that she even gave me a hug before I left caPS And i cOnnected most through our laughter the first time we met and from that date to even now every time we see each other we giggle and smirk Since we found each other or in my case her brother found me I have gone to her house every other weekend My sister is one of the most precious people I have in my life and that will never change because nothing we say or do will ever stop the laughing and joy we hold towards one another,43
12690,We couldn't control our selves our eyes watering and our stomachs hurting so much we can't move I was choking on my words as I talk to my best friend pERSON Every time we talked to each other some one would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing When I look back on the things that we talked about most of what we said did not make any sense at all and i don't know why we laughed so hArd one day at our bus stop person said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came than i said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school this happened almost every day for us on this particular day we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our class room our caps grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named caps that week was person is and my week tO take care of him when wE WENT to feed him person grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage we both thought this was the most hilaRious thing ever our eyes starTed watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class we laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work eventually our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quite this did not stop us from laughing we tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop on this day lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as location and i were we were so loud i thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure it was not just us being loud it was the whole class our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quite but that did not stop us in fact it made location and i laugh even more i thought i was going to pEe my PANts i was laughing so hard now person and i were not the kind of GIRLS who giggled quiet about things we were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day our teacher wanted the whole class to be quite so she got in front of the class while we were doing our match problems she told us to put down our pencils push in our chairs and stand behind them so we did then she told us to take a really big deep breath in and we did next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold lastly we were suppose to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our match problems silently with out talking to anyone when person and i were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with we thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us the class started to laugh there heads off and the teacher did not know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we did not behave eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly except for person and i we kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over we got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were suppose to even to this day every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something person and i look at each and start laughing and than we breath really fast now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all i think its just a part of being best friends with someone some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the caps grade through out our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important i believe that person and i will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together weather its in a class on the bus while we are driving at college or on the phone laughing is something that everyone needs to experience in there life time not a giggle or a small laugh out loud but a really hardy laugh were you can't control yourself your eyes are watering and your stomach hurts to bad to move just like person and i did in Caps grade,36

12697,Middle school was a challenging environment Not only are kids subjected to a rapid advancement in the academic environment but a maturing social environment as well The rapidly growing need for social dominance and in turn inflating egos makes for a bully breeding ground Without the skill to be able to laugh it off i would fear for anyone is mental well being in that environment throughout my first numb years in middle school i struggled with the building social discomfort of classmates higher in the social chain making for a severe toll caps not only my self esteem but my academics as well the stress of my own social stature plummeted my grades continuing a cycle resulting in even more stress the whole situation seemed hopeless and depressing i could not believe that in only a little over a decade of life my outlook had become so grim i wondered how i would make it through the rest my school years everyday i had the pleasure of hearing any number of new insults made up by those higher in the social ladder attempting to supplement their growing self esteem and inflating egos caps some days even those who i previously believed to be my friends joined in with them except for a few trusted companions it seemed the whole world was out to further themselves by bashing me with any number of new insults being made fun of daily had continued until i realized something that laughter is key in social survival without laughter there was no way i could have survived those school years after this revelation i was able to laugh at things said to me and laugh at myself as well i was able to take the the cacophony and learn with it taking it as critique to better myself through laughter and their jarring remarks i was able to secure my position in the social scheme as well as improve my intelligence as well as make new better friends and come to peace with others while maintaining the the hurt i experienced earlier to be popular without having to make fun out of those who were like who i used to be caps a win win scenario laughter is key in any situation whether it be a conversation with a friend or experiencing the penned up frustrations of immature adolescents from laughter i learned a great lesson one that i hope everyone has not learned should without the lesson of laughter i don't know how anyone could leAD A successful and pleasurable life,40

12700,Most people think that laughter helps you live longer love longer and show who you really are I believe all of that is true laughter is one of the most important things a person can do In my life laughter has helped me threw the hardest situations and made them a lot better yOu can laugh a lot with friends family or people you barely even know Laughing can mend relationships and help you get threw anything in my life i have found that out many times My mother and myself have not always had the best relationship we don't always get along and since i have a severe separation anxiety from her we spend a lot of time together which can cause friction from being together too much there was a certain time when we had just gotten into a fight about me wanting to go somEwhere and her not letting me i was expecting her to be mad at me for awhile for how rude i was being wE did not talk for a couple hours and tried to stay away from each other we would only talk to each other if it was really important After a couple days of this going on i went into her room to talk to her about it all when we talked i understood why she was so mad at me and i apologized and left her room but i could still feel that there was some tension between us I wanted to make things better more then i have ever wanted anything i was not really sure if she was ready to get over this fight so i thought it would be better to give her some space and let her come to me when she was ready to talk We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about The next day we went to go do somethings around town some grocery shopping and to see some family In the beginning we did not really talk much or anything Within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together we were joking around and laughing at everything each other said aFter our errands we went out to lunch it was the funnest time i had ever had with my mon we talked about everything and laughed and had an amazing time tHe days after that were wonderful also we spent a lot of time together and felt like we did not want to leave each other i know that laughing together and talking really helped with that we opened up to each other like we never had before I love my mother and care for her more then anyone in the world when we got into that fight i was scared out relationship would never be the same again we were able to work it out by laughing I honestly think that laughter can cure anything from a broken heart to a broken family,34

12704,You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day Well i would have to be agree to that because when I'm at school I would laugh all day long when i see my friend name PERSON We would have fun all day long just the three of us in the same classes but two classes but we still be laughing in the halls and in the class rooms some times at each other and people that we don't know I always loved coming to school last year but this year is not that much fun because PERSON moved into the CAPS is and I don't know where she lives now but after PERSON left the good old days was fun with her it sucks that we are not going to the same schools with her or her still coming to school with us now it is just the two of us lOCATION and my self we hardly have some fun in class without her but most of the days we do i rEmember when PERSON first came to this school she look like the other girls in our class but once we got to know her we became best friends the next day she though that we would not like her because is a new kid at the school and that stuff we got to know her all to well because we would hang out with etcher teacher back from the seventh grade we would hang out The thing that i always love about PERSON is that she would turn anyone whom is having a bad day and turn it into a really good day for you she would always do things like that but there are some days when she is felling down and blue and PERSON and me would try to make her feel but she would just get mad at us because we was not there for her when she needed us i felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what the next day she wouldn't remember what was going on yesterdAy because she wouldn't remember that much when she is really mad at someone one time in one of my classes we was not doing much in that class because there was not that much people in there we were painting And me and person was painting bulletin board the colours was white and brown we kinda of got it all over the place and each other i panted her hand haft brown and the other side white and she got some of it on the paper that we was using to let it dry up so we can paint again but that did not work out so good because we had to go to our next class the next day we was in that class we almost the same thing but we kinda of got it on the grand sink sops descender and each other we draw a little something on each other i draw a heart that has her name in it her name was in pen and the heart was in paint in our next class we was laughing the rest of the day we even got my sister location to laugh with us even through it was not that funny because we ate a lot of candy and candy makes us laughter all the time these days are the days that i'll remember all the time because person location and i are always laughing all that time because we always find something to laugh about and talk about out of all the times that i laugh the most fun ones are with my friend person because we would have lots of fun when we are with her she is the glue that was holding us together i think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day no matter what we did or did not do we would laugh all that time this one we would say like all the time in one of our classes that we would have all that time during fifth because we was the only two girls in there with four boys and a guy teacher so person and me would dO ALMOst anything in that class because we would not do anything that would get us in trouble,30

12706,laughter caps caps for the ORGANIZATION is a very important thing in life I personally could not live without laughter in my life I honestly could not do it i would not be me if i did not have laughter in my life all relationships should have laughter involved in some way what would a relationship be without laughter laughter is a beautiful thing when i am laughing i am enjoying life in in my own way and my worries instantly go away and some how i feel like i am carefree laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships but let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad i have always been very close to my dad you might even say i am a daddy little girl laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad it somehow always found its way into our relationship the caps times of laughter are what i valued and treasured so much that whenever i think about it i cant help but smile i remember when i was little if i ever needed a caps laugh my dad was the person to call the laughter grew stronger through out the years i cannot recall a time where my dad and i had a moment where laughter was not involved we always used to watch these caps shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard we would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family sometimes we did not even know why we were laughing it would just happen i can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and i of how i miss those caps numb nights were what i looked forward to i knew that i would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces i looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing of what caps times those were since my dad moved to location we have not had those beautiful times of laughter that i miss so much but i can always treasure them in my heart those moments of laughter were the best moments i have ever had with my dad since i was little girl till now almost an adult i don't know if my dad and i would be as close today if we had not had all that laughter throughout our lives whenever i am sad or miss my dad i go back to those times we had filled with laughter and listen to his laugh playing in my head i never knew how important laughter would be to me i am glad laughter played such an important part in my life laughter is such an important part of life relationships because it brings joy and happiness laughter is the type of thing that no matter what should always be a part of any relationship i think laughter is healthy for our bodies for example if you re sad depressed or just not having a caps day a caps laugh will change that and make you feel A lot better like it did for my dad aNd i laughter Also makes relationships last longer the reason why i am so close to my dad best friend mon boy friend sisters etc is because of laughter itself if laughter was not involved in my relationships i could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life my dad is the reason why i laugh so much he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple i never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is where i would be today without laughter i trUly have no idea my dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship if laughter was not involved in any relationship the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles can you imagine having no laughter at all i certainly cant imagine life without laughter if my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today what do you think aBout laughter has lAughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships,40

12709,High school years are tough for many teenagers if you don't have a friend that is always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst times i had a great friend named PERSON She had that special power of making me laugh no matter what We stopped being each others friends around the end of our sophomore year It was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a closer iT was not like we made enemy with each other but we did not end our friendship so nice and peacefully the date going into my junior year i had forgotten why we were not friends anymore if i did not remember why we were not friends anymore then obviously it was a stupid thing to fight about but things were said to one another so it would be a lot harder to make up i really did not want to be the one to apologise first i did the worst thing to our friendship and just let it stay like that it was the first day of my junior year i had not seen one sign of person anywhere it worried me because i thought she might of moved away and i did not get the chance to say good bye to her lunch had past and that is when i mostly saw everyone and there was still no sign of her anywhere as i walked to my last class of the day i was seated in the front row once i was settled there walked in location i had a little smirk on my face knowing she was still she had not moved away she turned to look at me with a serious look for that one second i had forgotten we were not friends my face became serious as well it was great knowing she was still living here but horrible knowing we still had not made peace with each other but i did not want to be the one to apologise first because i knew she would think i was the one to blame so leaving it like that was all i could think of the semester went by really fast seeing her everyday during class made it harder for me to even be in there i lost a really good friend from something i don't even remember have noticed sheds made new friends and has moved on with our friendship she still once in a while hung out with my group of friends when we both joined cheer leading we saw each other more after school but we still did not talk it really felt like she was actinG as if i never was a part of her life at first i hated her for treating me that way but i also had to take responsibilities for WHAT i had done to her one night i felt so out of it i really needed a friend that could just let me forget about my problems and bring a smile to my faCe the only person that came to mind was person i felt very alone at that time so i decided to write her an email it would have been better to have aid it to her face but i know i would have chickened out if i did it face to face so an email was better than nothing i told her i was wrong about a lot of the things that came out of my mouth i told her how much i missed her friendship and how much i missed heR presents around me i woke up tHe next morning feeling very sick to my stomach i did not want to go to school but i did anyways during lunch time i sat at my usual place in the halL person came out of no where and saT next to me she smiled and said remember when you tripped in the nUMB grade I could not stop laughing when she said that tEars came down face face for how hard i was laughing It felt like its been forever since I laughed that hard We talked a lot about our summers and about what news have been happening in our lives We laughed more than we talked I really had my funny best friends back aNd the laughs can go on again,37
12710,Laughter is a important part of life It is important in my life because it makes me happy I am going to tell a true story about why laughter is so important to me and to my life On days that I would be sad because of some stressful and unhappy things that were happening in my life at the moment mY friend caPS Would come to my house to cheer me up He would cheer me up by making me laugh a lot The main ways that he could make me laugh when he would notice that i am sad were tickling me randomly a lot saying a funny joke or asking me a silly question and by making me play a video game or two that I was very embarrassingly bad at The first way he can get me to laugh is by tickling me When he would come over we would just sit around and talk about random stuff that popped into our heads hE would notice me getting sad at some point and he would say that if i did not cheer up he would tickle me so that i laughed to get cheered up i wouldn't really cheer up so that he could make me laugh to Cheer me up so he would start to tickle me a lot i am ticklish basically everywhere so i would laugh hysterically and it was so much fun after he would finally stop tickling me i would still be laughing if i were to get sad again he would just keep on tickling me until he was sure that i was happy i would get happy that day because of laughter another day that he was over just hanging out with me i might not have been having that great of day we would be watching a movie and eating pop corn or watching to and he would notice that i was not really that happy so he would try and make me laugh to cheer me up he would get me to laugh by saying some funny silly joke or asking me a weird random question little funny things like that will always make me laugh through out the day or while watching the movie he would say something like it is so nice outside when it really was not he was just making me laugh or something in the movie would happen and he would say how that would never be possible in real life he would just get me to laugh to cheer me up in addition to tickling me and saying something funny to make me laugh he would also make me play a video game to get my mind off things at his house one time he said that we should play some fun video games for something to do because it would be rainy outside at first he would show me how good he is at one of his favourite video games like assassins caps then he would say that i should try to play it i was not very good at it but it was fun i am not used to the controls of an caps caps so I wouldn't know how to do some things anD he would make fun of me fOr it because it was actually supposed to be easy when i couldn't do something i would laugh about it and give the controller to him because i couldn't do it and he could that would make me laugh because i couldn't do something simple like run up a wall in the game so i would have to give it To him to do and that was funny to us being bad a vIdeo games is funny to me and it make me laugH in turn that would make me happy which is important in conclusion by my friend CapS tickling me a lot saying something weird and random that is silly and funny or by getting me to play video games that i was bad at and had to have him do it for me would make me laugh by him making me lauGh a lot it made me very happy laughing is very important part of my life and this story it is important because if i did not laugh as much as he makes me i would not be as happy if i am not happy that is not a good thing because being happy is a very important part of aNy life and relationship most of the ways i can get happy are by laughing so this story shows that laughing is very important part of my life you could also say that is important in my relationship with caps he make me laugh which makes me happy that is very important to me,36
12711,Laughter is the shortest distance between two people For the longest time I never thought that I could be happy I felt as if every time I tried someone was always there to say capS NO sheds about to be happy better take everything away from her that is caps always happened i was the one being dumped cheated on or losing a best friend i would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe someday someone out there would listen and care and understand i did not think that wish would come true but somehow it did person was the type of guy you could tell anything to he would listen and care as if it was his problem also that is caps attracted me most to him his sense of knowing when things were not right and attempting to make them better the thing i loved most about him was how he could make me happy when i felt so down he did not live close to me he never came over and we barely knew each other but he made me smile better then anyone have know for years i guess i never believed laughter is the shortest distance between two people it did not take long for that to be proven wrong freshman year and i was lost i just wanted to be popular make friends and get a good boyfriend my main focus that drove me through each class period was boys it was not the best thing i could have focused on but hey they got me through i still remember sitting in my match class when a tall boy with brown blond hair sat in the front row person was his name and i suddenly became attached i did caps most girls do when they see a cute guy made a fool of myself i was so sure that i was never going to get a chance with him until i got his number the story goes on from there we dated and dumped for a while we did not talk but that is caps made us bond even more we later became best friends and that is how i became happy my boyfriend was not a good boyfriend at all it took me a while to realize this because i was entranced on his ability to make me feel important i assumed i was not important when i called person crying the night he cheated on me usually when you ask a boy to help you with your problems they don't know caps to say but when i talked to person he seemed as if he was going through the same thing his perspective on the dilemma helped mE get through it i talked to him for the longest time that night explaining how i felt to my surprise he actually cared and listened after hours upon hours of talking person and i finally realized that we have to be related in someway him and i have so much in common we have both been through the same scenarios and we both help each other get past it one time after a dance person called me saying i cried when person left tonight i helped him then later that month he thought she was cheating on him i helped him i remember calling him one night and he woke up just to hear me tell him i quit the dance team people tell me not to get too attached to him but i cant help it we don't eVEN have to be in the sAme room and he makes me smile all the things we have been through make me laugh he makes me laugh he is not the class clown or the comedian but its just something in the way he can be himself and not get embarrassed that is caps makes him so fun to be around we month fight and not get along sometimes but i know he will always be there when i need him sometimes i sit and think back to the beginning of the year when i was timid quiet and unhappy i think of how person is the most caring guy but you wouldn't notice it unless you got to know him i think caps if i never met person and i WONDER if i would be the same person i am today i now reCognize that i have changed so much over these few monthS maybe its from person or maybe its just myself but i'm pRETTy sure laughter has somethinG to do with it it brought me and person together in the beginning and it keeps us together even now from being total strangers and now best friends maybe it is truE laughter is the shortest distance between two people,40

12727,My best friend and I have been friends since third grade wEave shared many laughs memories and tears yet to this day were still closer than ever one of the key reasons weave been able to stay friends for so long is because we make each other laugh we joke around and we make any boring time into a good one this is the story of how our relationship came to be and some of the reasons why we are still best friends it started in third grade i was walking alone on the playground when she asked me to play with her having nothing else to do i agreed we played for the whole recess and it eventually became a regular thing for us to spend recess together the first time she invited me to her house i was kind of nervous i was afraid it was going to be awkward or that we wouldn't have a good time when we got to her house after school we went to her room played video games for a little bit and then we had a snack we brought our crackers to her room sat on the ground and started to eat out of no where we just looked at each other and we started laughing like crazy they were not little giggles either we laughed so hard it brought tears to our eyes from that day forward we hung out as often as we could a couple of years went by we hung out more often and declared ourselves best friends when fifth grade came around we were glued to the hip her dad was our teacher so he already knew how close we botH WERE WE NEVER REALLY GOT TO SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER BUT WE STILL MANAGED TO TALK A LOT ONE DAY AT RECESS WE WERe joking around and she said your butt is so big you re going to break a chair these days it does not seeM that funny but in fifth grade it was hilarious when we got inside we played this match game i got the quesTion wrong so i plopped dowN in my chair sure enough it broke other kids that heard what she said laughed but no one really quite laughed as much as we both did fifth grade was also when boys started coming into the picture during date break she really liked this one guy and when he said he did not like her she was completely broken that night she came over to talk with me about it but we never ended up talking about it at all instead we watched funny movies and i would do thiNgs on purpose to make her laugh even thOugh we were already really close that night made us grow even closer at the end of fifth grade we had a little graduation ceremony towards the end they put on a slide show of everyone in the fifth grade class one of the pictures was of person and i with mud masks on we were both embarrassed but we also laughed because we had a lot of fun that night and we wondered how the picture got on the slide show after the ceremony person and i threw a party we shared many laughs and still that made us grow even closer even though we had made new friends that night our bond was unbreakabLe middle school was a whole new experience new friends different classes and more drama i hate to say it but we grew apart those three years we had none of the same classes and we both met new people but every time i went over to her house or every time we hung out we laughed till we were crying and gasping for air a lot of things happened our different friends fought some of them moved but our ability to make each other laugh kept us together through thick and thin towards the end of our middle school lives we grew closer again and things were pretty much back to normal today person and i are as close as we were in fifth grade if not closer when we are together not only do we make ourselves laugh but we make other people laugh as well we are together almost every weekend and we month not do much but we always end up laughing like crazy dOing cheer we also spend even more time togeTher other things in our relationship are important too Like trust loyalty and kindness but laughter is what has kept us together through everything we have been through laughter is also the reason we have become friends in the first place and i am happy to call her my best friend without her my life would be very boring and i hope we stay friends for the rest of our lives laughing keeps people together and makes relationships grow stronger this was an example of how it helped me and my best friend become fRiends and stay friends through everything life has thrown at us,37

12729,laughter why do people have so much trouble trying to laugh Is laughter a healthy thing you should have in your health chart This are some questions you might ask yourself But when you do have you thought of yourself and may have you thought of how much you and your family laugh all together at the dinner table or may the family room anywhere as long as you hear laughter coming out of your mouth It does not matter an what you laugh about it can be one of your family members telling a joke or even a funny show or a funny commercial it does it matter as long as you laugh in my opinion laughter is an important part in your life if you done laugh then you must be a very serious person or you might even think that the world is a very boring place to be in some how i cant really imagine a person never laughing in their life Some examples of people that done really laugh anymore is probably a person that lost someone close to them or that just does it have anybody to tell jokes with in my opinion you have to have someone to share stuff with or that will tell you jokes when your in a really bad mood I always used to remember my mon telling my little brother an i to quiet sown when we would talk in the family table during dinner one day One day i went to school and i went into health class it was weird because the teacher was talking about how we should share stuff in the dinner table and have some laughing moments sO when i got home a told my mother all about what the teacher had taught us during health class shE said of and we tried it It really was a good experience we were all laughing telling jokes all the time and since then we tell jokes in the family table It really does give you some energy sometimes but at the same time if you laugh way too much your stomach will eventually start hurting Like i told you in the first paragraph there many different ways you can laugh for example if you watch a comedy show i very good idea would be PERSON that show always makes me crack up sometimes my mon thinks in crazy Or ever family CAPS that such a great show to watch were your really in a bad mood Another way to make someone laugh is telling jokes there the knock knock shows and then there the guess what i am jokes but one way your really going to make somebody really laugh is tickling that always works there no way you cant ever make someone laugh wEather have someone always do it for you because i know that you cant do it to yourself that would be really weird or have a CAPS see who laughs first contest It wont always help you with your problems all the way but it will make you feel good for a little bit it will really make you forget about the bad things for a while i heard that if you laugh a lot sup silly you live longer so i think it does help you with your problems,30
12730,During the dATE I decided to join ORGANIZATION I raised a market pig and was determined to sell it at the lOCATION Raising a pig was time consuming and hard work wIthout patience great teachers and having fun I wouldn't have been able to do it tHat daTE I had some great experiences and some of them not so great This was my first time being involved with ORGANIZATION also my first time raising a pig I never thought that I would have so many awkward moments One of my awkward yet funny moments happened when I was shovelling pig poop with my friend ORGANIZATION thIs was also ORGANIZATION is first time being involved with organization and raising a pig organization and i were just trying to hurry and get our work finished so that we could go back to our homes and shower turns out i was in to much of a hurry my boots sank into the mud and poop which made me lose my balance i tried using the shovel to catch my self but it was too late i was covered in pig poop and mud from head to toe i had fallen in it organization and i looked at each other for what seemed to be two minutes but was only about six seconds then we busted out in laughter after our laughing was under control she helped me get up and we went to go find our agriculture teacher person when person saw my once blue pants now brown he couldn't help but laugh at me he got his camera out and took some picture of me that are very embarrassing but make myself and others smile after all the joking laughing and pictures were finished person gave some old clothes to wear for my ride home i had to roll the window down because the car got pretty smelly when i arrived home i headed straight for the shower this is an experience i will never forget if i did not have friends around me i don't think i would have thought of the experience as something positive and funny because person and ORGANIZATION were there to help me AND LAUGH With me i got some pretty fun memories out of that date raising a pig without the laughter it might of been a little negative i might have been mad or embarrassed or sad laughter is an important element to have in a positive healthy lifestyle,40
12731,Some people say that laughter is the best medicine i strongly agree with these people because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can put anyone into a better mood Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do hAving a good time with friends and family and laughing with them is truly something to be grateful for i have had several situations filled with laughter capS I am grateful for My two best friends peRSON NumB And i well lets just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not laughter involved sO many times weave laughed at ourselves and each other have lost count its so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with there are so many times that we have laughed at each other i don't even know where to begin one time we WERE ALL AT ORGANIZATION IS HOUSE AND WE WERE PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK IN HER BACK YARD IT WAS MY TURN TO BE THE SEEKER I CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AFTER COUNTING TO NUMB AS I SEARCHED THE YARD I FOUND EVERYONE EVENTUALLY EXCEPT PERSON AS I WONDERED THE YARD LOOKING FOR HER THE OTHERS STARTED HELPING ME LOOK FOR HER WE COULD HEAR HER LAUGHTER COMING FROM SOMEWHERE BUT WE COULDN't tell where shE started talking to us saying thiNgs like caps here or caps way after getting frustrated and giving up she finally revealed herself on the roof of her house we all laughed so hard not even knowing How she got up there in the first place Another time we had gone to pizza for my nUMb birthday party we went into the arcade room with the money we had ready to play some games we told ourselves to avoid the claw machine because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money But of course ORGANIZATION had to try it just once Next thing we knew we were using all of our money trying to win at CAPS game we each eventually won something screaming cheering and laughing hysterically like kindergarteners We had also played cAPS race car game at least ten times and we were running out of games to play So to relieve our boredom we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands iT was a very fun time I couldn't possibly tell all of these stories That would take hours days maybe even weeks But I can tell you that laughter is definitely a huge part of our day to day lives I consider myself a very lucky person to have such great friends that laughter is such a common thing for us Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have this opportunity A little laughter can go a long way So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh talk to them attempt to be their friend make them laugh tHe result will be its own reward tRust me,38
12732,I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh is a greatly valued thing Sometimes just sitting around and telling old stories or playing board games can leave you with a sore gut because you have been laughing so hard Many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them Family vacations are always chaotic at least in my family but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another Every winter our family gets together and goes to ORGANIZATION to stay in our cabin there A long weekend full of good food trips to the mountain snowball fights and family games is a great environment to spark some laughter Every year we bring big family games such as lOCATION caps AND locatiON My family members and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room in which the game is being played tends to escalate almost through the roof The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments over things like how in the world is that a picture of a sock or thaT is not fair you know the actual definition i enjoy these times because they are memories that you can hold onto forever laughter is a part of happiness and happiness needs to be a part of life spending time with those who make you laugh are those that are worthy of your time wiser people than myself say that life is short i'm starting to realize that this statement is true iF life is short then that time should be spent in the best way it can be moments filled with laughter,40

12738,fOlded iN daTE It was right around date two of my friends and I were out riding quads laughing and having a great old time They were teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad Soon after they started teaching me i figured out that what I had to do was hit all of my weight on the back end of the quad and of lore the gas so I could pop the front end up and I was just doing it fairly well from there on out wEll when we were about ready to to go back up to the house one of my friends thought it would be super cool if we got a picture of one of us up on the front of the quad while the person driving pops a wheelie To do this one of us sat on the front of the quad one of us sat on the back of the quad and one of us was driving first thing we do when were all situated in the quad is that the driver pulls back a flores the quad the driver does not need to slam down on the back of the quad because there is the extra weight from the person on the back which in turn pops the front end up then the person on the back jumps off and snaps a picture on their phone and then the person driving is supposed to brake and set the quad down lucky me i was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie while he was popping the wheelie either he pulled back to far and hard or he flores it for too long so i was sitting on the front and it stayed up in the air for about five seconds and then the scary thing happened the quad started leaning back so my friend jumped off and tried to hold it so i had some time to jump off but i panicked and froze to the bar i was holding on to then the whole quad came down on me because my friend couldn't hold me up any longer it slammed me into the ground all numb lbs of it it caused my shins to hit me in the face i have a hard time bending my head to my knees let alone my shins and it super hyper extended my back so much that i was lucky i did not break it when it hit me into the ground it felt like my legs sprung the quad off of myself but it was really just my friend pushing it off after the pushed the quad off of me i was laying there for like numb minutes laughing in pain for some reason that i can't remember after i was done screaming yelling and laughing in pain i got up and they drove me back up to the house when we got back up there they handed me an ice pack and told me to go sit on the couch i couldn't bend my back so i could sit down so i had to turn my back to the couch and basically fall onto the couch while i was sitting there my back started to hurt excruciatingly bad so i thought if i lay Flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as bad and just like i thought it did so i slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way i could get comfortable the next day i woke up in really bad pain it took me like two minutes to get off the floor it hurt so bad shortly after i woke up i called my parents and had them come and pick me up from the house i just barely got into the truck and my dad and i drove back to my house and i told my parents the whoLe story And my mon freaked out and thought i hurt myself extremely bad so she took me to the doctorS office and he looked me over and told me i would just have to wait for my back to heal its self and then i went home,36
12739,Most people believe that laughter is an essential need for your heath not only physically but socially as well In a socially tense environment it is hard to achieve what is expected of you but if someone will introduce laughter into the environment it quickly changes into one that becomes more simplistic and you are able to get done what is expected of you wIth this mindset i proceeded into the conference room for the first time since peRSON Had left persoN was the adviser for the ORGANIZATION or what we call ORGANIZATION perSON WAs the reason that a student from each school in locatION HAD any say in what the ORGANIZATION did or received school wise She helped us voice our opinions and that made her a hero in the eyes of many high school students sOon perSON IS time as adviser had expired and she announced her departure from her position after a few weeks had gone by she had found a new adviser to take her place person i'm a person who is excepting of change but the other members are not this particular change was much to hefty for them they just wanted things to go back to normal when i sat down in my usual chair the room seemed much less homely and i soon felt a sick feeling building up inside i did not know who this woman was or what she was going to do all i knew was that she was not person and she did not make the organization members very happy person glided into the room with a welcoming spirit about her she stood at the head of the room and smiled the rest of the members sunk a little further into their chairs as if they were protesting her arrival i thought to myself she does not stand a chance as i sat a little taller and began to listen to what she had to say she spoke in a cheerful tone and seemed to giggle after every sentence although her posture provoked confidence her giggle struck nervousness there was only one way we as a organization were going to get done what was needed we had to see person as a friend not a foe immediately i decided to lighten the dank feeling in the room by starting a name game this is a fun activity to learn a little more about people and to help person to remember our names person seemed much more relaxed after the game so we continued with the meeting with eVery second getting more serious i proposed that the meeting be done for the week and we spend the rest of the time talking and laughing about what had gone on that week this made everyone smile time went on and with every passing moment the stress in the room became lighter and lighter until the whole room was filled with laughter it was as if person had never left soon the gathering came to a close and we all went home on my way out person stopped me and told of her nervousness before the meeting because she was not sure how well everything was going to go she was thankful that i jumPED RIght in and helped brighten the spirits of the members this eventually lead to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of organization by the next meeting the members were all anxious to go back and learn a little more about person and were able to more fully concentrate on the matters at hand laughter helped the members of the organization accept what they could not control and ultimately lead to our success today laughter is primarily the key to all suCcess in the social society we live in today with laughter anything is pOssible although the lauGhter was only for that one meeting it allowed the members to be moRe welcoming to the idea of pERSON and made for a life long friendship between our adviser and the members of our ORGANIZATION my relationship with person would not be as strong as it IS TODay if i did not share the opportunity to laugh at person iS first ORGANIZATION meeting,43
12740,pERSON in a mother and daughter relationship capS NEed laughter its sO important to have that connection with someone that is so important and close to caps just in general caps need laughter it shows how caps express yourself and it brings out your character this one laughing experience it was the date of my eighth grade year so i was numb or numb my family and family friends went on a camping trip so the day before we were suppose to leave my mother brother and myself went up to set up camp we when got to the campground we immediately started putting everything together and organizing it was a lot of fun but it was getting dark fast so we moved faster until it was completely finished on our way out we noticed that we forgot something in the truck so my mon stopped the truck and looked at me and asked caps caps want to drive right now of course i did not think twice i jumped out of the truck and ran to other side all sorts of excitement was going through my body when i got to the other side i hopped right onto the driver seat with the biggest smile on my face my mon was giving me all the steps on before starting the truck examples seat belt steering wheel mirrors and adjusting the seat the family vehicle was a stick shift so i was all sorts of nervous i had no idea on how to shift and when to exactly i used to watch my mon and step dad when they shifted and when i would make humming noises but that obviously did not help me any the first thing i had to caps was to start the truck because mon turned it off before she got out i had to put the clutch in all the way and make sure it was in neutral so i started that thing up thinking to myself on how cool i probably look right now the average numb year old ego the going part was the worst i probably killed the truck about numb times before the tires actually went at a constant speed that they should be going at my mon said the fifteenth time is a charm she probably thought she was being funny but trust me it was not a funny moment i gave a nervous laugh right back at her which probably did not make me feel any better so i started the truck once again and go to moving i was not going very fast more like the speed of a turtle but that was alright with me because i had no idea what was going on the truck was going too slow to go anywhere so i pushed in the gas a little bit harder coming around the bin going about roughly numb miles per hour still at a slow pace as before the camp ground was only about numb to numb miles away which seemed like it was taking forever we were coming up to the campground i could tell because we had a sign that said person with a arrow pointing left so i took that left and saw all of our stuff there was a river on the back side of where of our camp was and trees were circling all around us so it was an enclosed area except for one side where caps could see to the other side of the river and there were other people camping on the other side which was kind of nice because they had kids my age my mon pointed and told me to go over by the tent and park for an inexperience driver i got anxious and put my foot onto the gas instead of the break so that numb my a went up to about numb in the matter of seconds we were going so fast that i couldn't really react to what was going on all i could hear was my brother in the back seat yelling like when a little girl finds a spider my mon grabbed onto the steering wheel as fast as she could because we were heading right towards the river and was about to make a quick visit to the people across the waY INstead of going that direction we went into a pick nick table and pushed that right into another one and landed right onto a third table we were at least numb feet off the ground onto the pile of broken tables i had a adrenaline rush and i'm pretty sure the passengers did too we all got out of the truck and literally stopped and starred at the situation for a good numb minutes before we started busting up laughing we all looked over across the river and saw their entire family Just starring and LAUghing at us my mon looked at thEM For a few seconds and then looked at us and said caps aLl can come over later for a fire,40

12742,i Was in numB Grade when it was almost the last day of school so since middle school years have been the lamest years of my life I thought of my brothers pranks he had done while he was in middle school and one of them that was the funnest was the fire alarm prank hE told me the story to me all the time and that he did it a lot of times and also got away with it I know I should at least try it since this was my last year in middle school and I should just go for it well nuMb days before school was out i had a lighter with me and i had went into the girls bathroom I noticed there was a alarm on the top of the roof so I stood on top sink and turned on the lighter waved it around the white round fire alarm and then once I knew it it went off My friend was with me at the time I was thinking about it and told her before i did what i was going to do at the time and so she knew what i was about to do But anyways back to what had happened we All went outside me and my friend were laughing so hard that everyone was looking at us with weird faces but then we told our closest friends what I had done and they all cracked up even some lower grade kids herd about it but that is because they were by us and at the end it did not get pretty it was last period and i was in computer class when my vice principal came and got me from class then took me into her room and she asked me if i was the person who turned off the fire alarm and i was like no then asked me again and i still said no finally she told me that when i was doing whatever i was doing to make it go off did i notice if there were people in the stalls at that time i said no and she told me that there were two people in there and one of them had told on me so it ended up with me getting in big trouble with being on probation going to the fire department to apologize for what i had did and how much time it takes for them to do there job on fires at school then had community service the whole date and almost did not get to walk in my promotion with the date class which got me down i do regret doing what i had done since i think of it all now it was something childish and stupid for some reason it was my funniest moment of my life and i'll always have that as one of my numb top favourite memories and moments of any school year true story,33

12744,bEing on a team does not always mean that everyone is the best of friends most of the time the case is that you really don't get along with the people on your team that was the case for the organization caps caps of location caps that i'm a member of everything changed after our trip to location location for ORGANIZATION it WAS latE TWelve mEMBERS Of thE ORGANIZATION caPs were shuffling into the location to check in everyone was in their group of friends talking and anxiously waiting to leave ORGANIZATION foR OUr eight day trip each group OF PEOPle did not always get along with the people in the other groups even though we were a team other people got along with everyone they just had their own close friends that they stuck with emotions were at a wide variety that night between the tension of conflict between people nervousness and excitement when our plane had finally landed in location everyone was completely drained of energy but once again everyone split up into their own groups and we moved through the location caps we walked through the location to the luggage claim i began to wonder caps is it that we are all together and a team but we separate ourselves to different groups amongst our team and everyone notices but it does not change caps i pondered the thought we headed out to the rental vehicles and loaded everything up and started the day after the long day of flying and touring places around downtown location we finally were at the hotel checking in caps we checked in everyone separated vastly with their groups of friends who they rooming with to check in to their rooms later that evening a few us that were really close friends went outside to hang out by the campfires they had at the hotel we were staying at caps we sat there talking and laughing having a great time there was a moment when we just sitting there quietly and i proceeded to ask them about what i been thinking about back at the location the response i got back from everyone was blank stares and a change of subject the next morning came early we went off to breakfast then left for the day to go do some touring the first place we went to out of three place we were to be touring that day was the ORGANIZATION at the organization our cAps faced our first team building bonding activity the task we werE to accomplish with one another was difficult at first for everyone but we all slowly began having a fun time laughing And working to accomplisH WHAT We needed after we had fInished the activity eVERYone began to slowly mingle with people outside their normal group later that same day we had a second team building bonding activity after we finished that ACTivIty there was a sense of less tension between everyone even less than from after the morning activity the Following day we had two more team building bonding activities eaCH TIME we had an activity everyone began to connect more and more and each time came more laughter we also began to spend more caps a whole caps and got have an even better time of fun and laughter filled adventures by the time we were all heading to the location to fly back to locatION everyone was hanging out and there was no conflict caps the plane took off the realization of everything had came to me of caps before there was so much conflict and everyone being split up into separate groups i realized that we had always been on a business like relationship with One another we never gave the chance to laugh have a good time and connect and allow us to get to know each other once we took the time to alloW all of those things we learned whO EVERYOne Was and made Friendships,37

12749,When I had turned fifteen I was so anxious to get my permit i did not study for it but i thought to myself how hard could this really be the first time i went to take the test i went with my best friend person person had already taken the test once and failed so she was trying again we got to the organization at numb am sharp i was anxiously sitting there waiting to take my test and that is when they called my number the women at the organization was very nice to me she said all i need is your birth certificate your social security and proof of enrolment i handed the envelope to her that i had containing all of these she okayed me to go and take my test i sat at computer number six i was not nervous at all i thought how could i not pass this when the test began there was so many questions of things i did not know like motorcycles left turns and things about animals that were on the road i finished the test with percent i only needed to get percent to pass i was bummed out that i had failed person however had passed her test i was happy for her and i congratulated her but i was still in a way jealous of her my caps and person told me its okay you will get it for sure next time caps they were wrong i was supposed to be one of the first people out of my group of friends who was going to get there permit i had no idea that all of my other friends would get it before i did it seemed like every week one of my friends would get their permit and just pass me up i was extremely discouraged and sad about this because in a way i felt like a failure but i was determined to get my permit no matter how many times it took me i went back date after taking my permit test for the first time to take my test again i failed i had failed for the second time i went back again five more times i failed my permit test five times my caps and i were driving back one morning after i had failed i was very sad because i was going to have to wait a whole month again before i could take it that is when my caps just started cracking up laughing hysterically at me i was very confused at why she would act this way she told me sometimes you just have to relax in situations and learn it is okay to not always get things right the first time life is about sticking to things and having fun if you can't laugh at mistakes that are made then what is the fun in that i realized she was completely right and that is when i stopped beatIng myself up over not getting my permit i laughed hysterically the rest of the car ride home i did not mind that i did not pass becaUse i knew i was gOing to get it if i just relaxed and studied the next month i went back to take the test again i went through all the steps In the ORGANIZATION again I waited for thEm to call my number i gave the women my information and i sat down at the computer i got percent this time i was so stoked and so happy that i had passed i was mostly just surprised my caps is advice had worked date that day i was driving home from the store with my caps i was not the best driver i think because it was only my first day and she was yelling at me to slow down and hit the brakes as i pulled into the driveway i had mistaken the gas for the break and i ran into the garage door surprisingly she had started laughing and this made me laugh instead of yelling at me and reaming me for this mistake we were able to laugh about it and i think that is what made a world of difference because if she would have yelled at me i would have been discouraged to try driving again now i have had my permit for four months not only am i a better driver but i have learned to relax a little bit more i have learned to laugh a lot more and not take so many great simple things in the world for granite i also think that it made me closer to my caps in a way so i guess it is true what they say laughter is the shortest distance betweEn two people,36

12752,There have been many times in my life in which laughter was the key ingredient mY family is always laughing We could be laughing at a movie or a joke someone just made We even laugh when the jokes are aimed at us The same thing can be said about me and my friends mY friends and i laugh at almost anything I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life without it life would be almost meaningless I can remember one dATE when my friends and I decided to go camping at a lake for a week We all packed up our tents sleeping bags and other camping necessities When we got to the lake it was not very crowded so we had no difficulty picking a camping spot once we finished unpacking our gear and setting up our tents we decided to go swimming one of my friends shouted i'll race you down to the lake caps took about five steps before caps stepped in a small hole the perfect size for his foot to fit in and caps fell flat on his face everyone started busting up laughing it was like we couldn't stop wHen my friend who had fallen finally got up caps was laughing too we spent the rest of the date swimming and making fun of his fall the best part about it was caps joked arOUND too that night we stayed up eating junk food hot dogs and stores till we almost burst then one by one we all passed out over the next couple days we did pretty much the same things we swam in the lake took hikes in the woods fished for a little while and made fun of each other laughing almost the entire time on the date that we were there we all decided to wake up early and take one date hike to the top of the nearest mountain the trip to the top went smoothly and no one fell or got hurt the only eventful thing that happened on the way up was that one of my friends dropped his water bottle aND Had to chase it halfway down the mountain to us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next before going down we all took a potty break as one of my friends called it the only problem with this was that one of my friends decided to pee in what caps thought was an empty hole as it turned out the whole was not empty but home to hundreds of underground wasps unfortunately for us caps did not realize this until it was too late wASPS began pouring out of there home searching for whoEver was disturbing them which happened to be us my screamed in horror caps crap its a bees nest the next thing i knew we were running As fast as we could down the mountain with seeMINGly thousands of waspS following us the lucky ones had finished relieving themselves and ran away with ease the unlucky ones were not quite finished and had yet to pull up their pants running with your pants around your ankles is not an easy thing to do just in case your wondering and two of my friends found this out the hard way as they tried to run away they tripped over themselves and started to roll all caps while they were being stung by the wasps WE All made it down the mountain with very few injuries and not too many bee stings i remember the first thing we did when we got back was laugh till We cried once we were out of danger this instance seemed like the funniest thing that had ever happened my friends and i still bring up stories about our crazy camping trip and the run in with the cranky underground wasps to this date i still think its one of the funniest things that will ever happen in my life and i am looking forward to the next crazy event i believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life without it life would Be almost meaningless,37

12756,Daughters importance in human life In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter caPS And friends always come together and share a good laugh its why we get together to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around my caps every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favourite times because when my caps shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying because you are laughing so hard he has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day caps is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter now add a laugh a few smiles and you have yourself a great time my caps has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny it is the timing in which he does it i wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the flavor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face because not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough and you never know that person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then its a domino affect he she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else is day better just by a small and simple laugh most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another sometimes that all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime so every one can share a good laugh it does not matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a hoot and a holler every now and then when i met now my best friend who is like a brother to me it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgettable laugh from that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in the military has to go to war and live in an hostile environment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and laugh about something it is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the laughter that wants to come out when your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becaUse THE people that truly care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day its like a refreshment for your body when i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both laughter is the key to life because it can turn anything negative into a positive when you go to a party with caps or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody i believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person it shows who they are because nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny its just not possible for somebody to do laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need when two or more people are gathered the ability to create an environment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this it is so true laughter is the shortest distance between two people,32

12759,In all of our lives there is that one person that is so special you would never do anything to hurt them Whether that person be a close friend a significant other or a family member The people that are involved in our lives significantly are there to help us through the rough patches bring us up when we are down and be there for us Friends are one of the most important people we have in life Friends are someone we can talk to and they understand someone we share everything with including clothes food etc theY are the ones that get us through each day with a smile high school is filled with drama its the same old story just a different day i have the best group of friends we are very close and spend a lot of time with each other at school and outside of school they are there for me when i need them the most recently this guy person and i have been trying to work on our relationship but he had been lying to me and cheating on me but everyone of my friends that i talk to abut the situation say the same thing he is going to hurt you and hers not worth your tears i have class with him every other day its not like i get to choose when i want and don't want to see him some days are just better than others the bell rang right after lunch and i was not in any hurry to get to the band room the band room is very big smells like old cheese and is like a trampoline for sound to bounce off of and explode in your face I don't enjoy that class at all I walked in the room nonchalantly and set all my books on my chair and began walking to my cubby I grabbed my instrument walked back to set it on my chair and went to talk with some of my friends iT had not been a bad day so far it was just a regular day at school entering the band room i had a feeling that date was different he walked through the band door with a huge smile on his face but i couldn't help but look away and frown mixed emotions are the worst he does one thIng and you love him and he does another thing that drives you insane and makes you want to hurt him he sits right behind me in band and i am constantly turning around to talk to him but we never seem to get in trouble except for date we were supposedly talking to much I don't believe we were talking to much because daTE Was where i wAnted nothing to do with him He was upset with me and I was upset with him so we were even tWenty five minutes passed by each minute dragging on longer and all I was thinking about was him and what I had heard he was doing iTs never a good feeling when you know something is wrong i confronted him about what people were telling me his response was don't believe what you hear believe what you see i did not know what was going on buT tears started pouring out of my eyes running down my face like a crystal clear waterfall i asked my teacher if i could take a minute out in the hall and she agreed so i sat in the hall with tears running down my face one of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me we started talking and i told her everything that was going on she gave me a hug and start making jokes about him i couldn't help but laugh i even smIled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well after a few jokes and a bunch of hugs the tears went away and i was smiling neither of us wanted to go back in class but we did not really have any other options we were not very close friends but our talk during class made us grow stronger even when everything is going wrong you should count on your friends to tell you the truth and give their advice because they are always right so don't second guess them they know how to make you feel better and it always seems to work laughter is much more than an emotion it gives you strength when you are weak it builds you up when you are down laughter brings relationships closer and sometimes all we need is to smile laughter also helps create memories the nights you stay up talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever laughter is an important aspect to everyone we all need a day to just relax and take a step back to laugh,40

12761,Have you ever seen the phrase cAPS capS LAugHter Have you ever asked yourself what it means I believe it can mean many different things for many different people There are some people that can take it negatively and then there is some that take it positively i believe that those numb words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life a perfect life is not about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearance in going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship in numb years old now but i was numb when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation he is a male tall brown skin he is numb years old now but he was numb when i met him it all started at school that where we met he always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and that what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke even embarrassing things that either happen to me or him he would turn them around to the point where i wouldn't feel embarrassed anymore i caps it how i can be myself with him he was the uphill on a rocky roll a coaster numb years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautifuL Twin daughter together and i caps my life to the fullest because he makes me happy instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but that what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship i have a best friend not only is she my best friend because sheds honest and kind but because sheds funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplest things ever most people monTh think we are crazy we are not that just the sound of a happy life i believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long life with laughter is like a survey road you just done know what to expect my mother and i have a pretty solid relationship we do a lot of Things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that comment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to eNjoy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you laughing at the memories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happen when and where so when ever something happens to you that you month consider embarrassing look back at it a year from that day in sure you will get a laugh or at least a smile out of it,31

12763,i woke up at nUMB from a cal from my cousin saying he wanted to hang out and introduce me to my cousin i have never met before after we got off the phone i hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as i could once they got to my house i frantically ran to the door and opened it really fast expecting some kind of reaction from my new cousin but the one i got was not what i expected right when i opened the door he began cracking up laughing at my for a couple of minutes i got kinda mad at him because i did not know what he was laughing at until i looked down and realized i had no pants on i rushed back into my room and put some shorts on and came back into the living room while they were still on the coach laughing at my stupid mistake i sat down on the couch across from them and asked them what they were laughing about and that i did it on purpose for a joke they did not believe me at all i don't blame them because that was the stupidest thing to say in that circumstance after they stopped laughing my cousin asked me if that was the only thing in done like that i replied no and he started on about some stories about him doing dumb stuff like i did that ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day just reciting dumb stories about ourselves that were embarrassing it turns out that just because i made that dumb mistake it made it easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in and just for that reason we have had a good relationship since we met in the end i was glad i did that because it made us really close because we can now just laugh at each other when either of us do stupid stuff and that is my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and i,35

12776,In the ninth grade I was required to give a speech about a book The speech was to be persuasive like a television or radio advertisement I am awful at giving speeches Before speeches my hands get clammy and cold I experience hot flashes and occasionally get nauseous duriNg speeches my eyes frantically glance around the room my breathing pattern changes to quick short breathes aLmost in sync with my glances At the end of my speeches I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock I do not speak i do not laugh and I feel like hiding Luckily caPS Speech was different my cAps class had all girls and one boy Not to say I am sexist but having the majority of the room being female did help Girls have a way of acceptance or at least creating a facade of acceptance and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say Everyone was making eye contact with me Compared to the average classroom setting of speech giving time when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other the classroom was zoned in on me tOday caPS felt like everyone was ready to hear me no matter what I really had to say and how professional caPS Came out i feLt superior as if I had the power to alter their lives almost so superior that i could spit propaganda at them and they would eat caPS Up caps It that what advertisement is Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea and hiding the bad things The group looked so innocent Today I was ready to give my speech just because of that spark of acceptance and a smile I began My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around cAPS to serve the purpose of a television caPS also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the actors caps THE first few lines of the speech my group of classroom peers laughed caps was not what they had expected i am a shy quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class I wear things like semi large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world A lot of times when I give speeches people laugh but usually a negative laugh The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone caPS Is also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter that just makes the speech a introduction and an ending bodiless So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction tHe sound of caPS laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech At the end of my speech everyone clapped tHey always clap capS is required to clap caPS Clap was different caps was clapping for the success of the speaker a clap that said capS SPeech had a clear purpose and made the audience want to keep listening capS WAs not a pity clap then I smiLed My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded tHat i had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what i had to say and that they had comprehended capS and maybe that they would now want to read the book caPS was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on tHe length of the speech was good not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying caPS was a definite improvement and also a factor of why they laughed They could hear my witty jokes and comments lAstly my puppets also had a introduction body and conclusion to their babble Usually I get so nervous I forget to say the body of the speech Laughter can be mean cruel and disrespectful My speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively tHe laughter of the audience was cheery happy encouraging and accepting,40

12780,it was CAPS ORGANIZATION of daTE the sun was shining and the birds were chirping iT was a great ORGANIZATION to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather tHere was a parade in LOCATION the parade that i Was in I loved being the enter of attention i loved to be seen and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade i was with my best friend person and her family there float was for organization which is the organizatioN organization that they had owned at the time we had a lot of children on the float probably about twenty with only person person is mon and the manager of the organization organization to help watch the kids the children were dressed up in animal costumes the older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float person and i were laughing the whole time i had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us we were carrying the two twin baby is i cant remember their names we switched off a few times but for the most part i was holding the boy while she was holding the girl they were well behaved baby is they did not cry often uNLESS WE HAD laUGHED TO HARd or yelled at the crowd too loudly we passed a bunch of people that we knew i had seen my cousins and a few aunts and uncles i couLd only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast after a while person and i had started to get tired from holding the baby is and walking around so we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail the rail was only nailed in so it was not very sturdy we figured that it would be fine though the parade continued we started to become even More tired and hot from the sun we felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone we leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion we were still laughing and having a good time but we became more and more relaxed And ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell there was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby Is at the time i was holding the girl and person was holding the boy the boy had just fallen to sleep the baby is were fine but the boy started to cry he was not hurt he was just shocked It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red bAileys mon came over to us to make sure we were all okay sHe handed the baby is off to the ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION manager who was there thEn perSON IS mon helped us up then we all burst into laughter Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives but it was the funniest moment as well Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade oNe time peRSON even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it was not there anymore aT the end of the parade peRSON Is family stood there waiting for us Uncle marks kids peRSON And persON came up and laughed at us and made fun pApa peRSON had asked if we were okay When he asked that pERSON and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off tHen we went home after that thaT ORGANIZATION was a good ORGANIZATION for us We went home and talked about what had happened We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side make a joke out of it or just laugh at yourself peRSON and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense and laughing at our selves had made us much closer Every relationship whether its intimate family or just friendship needs laughter or else the tough things in life will bring you down Laughing is what keeps you bold and strong If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever and it will effect you in the long run If you were to never laugh in a relationship then it wouldn't be a relationship at all tHat is why laughing is very important in everybody is lives,35
12781,When I was fourteen years old I think my family and I started riding four wheelers out in the sand mY parents friends are the one who got us started riding thE first time i Went out there i Had a numB ORGANIZATION four wheeler and i couldn't stop laughing because it was so small and everybody had big four wheelers and dirt bikes but riding out there with that thing was fun and my family would laugh every time my brother rode it up a hill because he would just ride the crap out of that thing aFter that ride we sold my four wheeler and got a nuMB ORGANIZATION Its the first time going to the dunes with my new four wheeler and I can't wait We get to the dunes unload everything get our riding gear on and our helmets with our goggles on It was thirty minutes of riding and my brother was jumping his four wheeler when some people showed up and was video taping him which made him show off a little bit So he was jumping in front of those people going further and further every time My family couldn't stop smiling and laughing because he was showing up everybody there who was trying to out jump him So when he got don't jumping the guys who were video taping him came up to us and they told us that he is really good and that we should follow them to another jump So my brother trying to be cool whipped his bike around and wrecked it was funny my dad and I were laughing so hard our eyes were tearing up but lucky for him my dad and I were the only ones to see his little crash So we went to go see if hes okay and he said yea so we took off mY brother and i were right behind them and our parents were no where in sight I turned my head to look and see if they were behind us and when I look ahead of me all I see is a roost of sand in my face which made me turn my handle bars so I hit a grass mound and the bike flew up in the air rolled off a little little hill and landed on my leg my brother did not knew he did that to me so i was stranded until my parents came i don't know why but i couldn't stop laughing because believe it or not that wreck was actually kinda fun and funny because no matter what i did i couldn't seem to get that four wheeler off my leg about ten minutes passed by with my four wheeler on my leg and i finally heard a loud noise it was my dad and he came to save me so i told him what happened and he couldn't stop laughing at me he told me he would get my brother back so when we were on our way back to the truck my brother was behind my dad and my dad roasted him with sand so bad it made his goggles fall off my parents and I couldn't stop laughing and we ended up pulling over so we could stop laughing at my brother after that my brother does not roost me anymore its been a year since we have started riding and still my brother has not yet roasted me he still tends to show off this one time my mods friends came out and my brother was trying to be cool and ride really fast from coming out of the dunes and he slid on the concrete and he wrecked in front of us and maybe like seven people it was hilarious everybody was laughing besides my mon he looked at his arm and he had road rash all down his arm well i guess that is what he gets for trying to show off its like every time he tries to show off he wrecks so why does he keep doing it i don't knoW why but maybe he should stop sometime so he does not wreck every time we go out there just kidding it does not bother me when he wrecks because they are usually funny i thinks that is why we hAve so much fun out there because of him,37
12782,Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh I have his name is peRSON TogeTher him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes smiling and enjoying ourselves iN any relationship or friendship laughter is an important quality In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible To begin with peRSON Is my closest friend We both are very fun and outgoing people We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humours This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much sOmeone once told me for every minute you laugh it adds a year to your life That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life Together we make the cAPS of the worst situations and move on from them Laughing is something that no one can live without It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life whether that be in a good way or even in a bad way Laughter in our relationship is like glue When things between us ever got rough or just things in general got hard we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong oNe of the ways our sense of humour came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed If you have never been through that before let me tell you its hard I remember everything about that day I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from cAPS When I answered his voice was timid and shaken I had never heard him sound like that before He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me aT first i was not too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious this time i was wrong Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway wHen he got to the door instead of just walking in like normal he knocked tO my surprise as he peeked his head in his face was as red as a cherry eyes swollen and watering and his voice quivering with sadness I knew then that this was serious After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to lOCATION Taking all that in at once was hard I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details wE then started to ORGANIZATION things that he could find there that would remind him of home This turned into a day of jokes oUr first mission was to find a caPS ORGANIZATION fail our second mission caps CAPS anOTHEr fail and finallY our third mission was to find anything that reminded him of me we came to tHe conclusion our caps idea would be cAPS capS In return we got in his truck and drove to cAPS capS ANd purchased two high tech caps CAMS and went home to set them up That in itself was a memory I will never forget When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us but we would not let that break us down We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself he moNTH never get to do again we spent hours playing capS box hours playing football in the yard and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding tHe reality of it is without laughter and fun we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it tO this day we still plan a specific time and caps IT up together in conclUsion although things get tough and overbearing there is always an escape thAt escape for me and my capS FRiend is laughter when Worse comes to worst turn your favourite cartoon on call the person who can always make you laugh spend hours doing pointless yet fun things enjoy what you have at your fingertips and laugh you monTH never know when those things can up and walk away,42
12783,Many things are said to bring people together These things can vary from favourite foods to fashion taste or even disliking the same people but nothing can bring two people as close as a good laugh can laUghing will always lighten the mood bring out a winning smile and from time to time a tear to the eye Laughing makes the bad days manageable and the great days fantastic In my perspective the world wouldn't go around without a good laugh every now and then bY good laugh i caps it mean the kind that makes you happy for a moment i mean the kind that brings tears to your eyes and creates a shaking feeling in your stomach the kind of laugh that you remember have had many of those moments but one that i cherish most just happened to occur during a school day a couple weeks ago i was having a pretty nice day sure its caps so the weather dampened my spirits a little but i was doing alright i had my normal classes got my average homework load and then it came time for caps caps is basically study hall at my school i sit at a round table in there with a few of my friends and we talk about nearly everything everyday i sit by person person and i occasionally sit and talk with everyone else but we tend to disengage ourself from the others and lock ourselves in our own private world of inside jokes smart ass laughs and people watching so that day during caps i can't quite recall what we were talking about at our table we all just couldn't keep ourself from laughing most of the laughing was just giggles and some of it was straight up hardcore red faced laughing after we all settled down from the most recent up roar of chuckling person started talking she somehow spit out the words caps it you guys you re making my eyes hurt amongst the Giggles still blossoming out of her mOuth after she said that I became puzzled I just stared at her and stuttered what I was sure she made a mistake and said eyes instead of stomach but after she replied with capS IT your eyes hurt when you laugh really hard i lost control i was laughing so hard i couldn't breathe and i felt like i was going to pee seE the funny part is person is caps so tHe idea of her eyes hurting from laughing really hard is just uncontrollably funny after person and i caught our breath we asked other caps around the room if their eyes hurt when they laugh and guess what they caps this only made us laugh harder this occasion instantly became another inside joke we treasure that inside joke is by far one of the funniest ones and it being funny just makes it funnier every time she laughs i ask caps your eyes hurt and we just burst into more laughter the idea of the joke alone brings a smile to my face that being the reason why laughing is such a big part in our world it brings happiness joy and love well actually it brings just about every positive emotion i month not be a doctor yet but i know i'm right when i say everyonE should get their dAily dose of laughter lauGHTER can cuRE just about anything,40

12785,aLl of the memories that have shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness just enjoying life and being teenagers but on the other hand sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness day to day frustrations vital playoff games that weave lost by small margins or the passing of important people in our lives i think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory laughing and crying and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day as children were very impressionable so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad its going to have an effect on us and be remembered i think its known by everyone that teenagers are not necessarily the most logical thinkers some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble I'll speak for my generation when i say that our actions are not always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do for instance my friend person has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times she washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile long gravel drive away from the candy apple red paint on her organization this wouldn't bother me except that every day afteR school i go to her house along with our other friends caps and person to kill time before practice the group is always anxious to get away from school because were tired hungry and just want to get to her house and relax but person never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed one day person became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than person was driving person decided to take her up on the offer stopped her car and person proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car soon she was a good distance ahead of us dancing and skipping toward our destination however she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough she climbed on the hood and we continued driving slowly we were about two hundred feet from location is house just one small bend before wed be there when person realized that if her grandparents who live right next door saw us then shed be in trouble she did not care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway person slid off the hood granted we were only going about eight miles an hour and momentum pushed her forward at a trot she slid on the gravel road landed on her rear skipped across the ground and then stopped those of us who had remained in the car were in shock our mouths agape and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting she then stood up turned to face us and burst into hysteric laughter we all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes all of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day and told all of our other friends about it we had realized that it was a stupid thing to do and person could have been hurt but she was not and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment laughter has that ability to connect people it takes effort to make someone laugh to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain caps i'm having fun caps crying is a sign of extreme sadness laughter is a sign of joy and elation an indication of happiness it shows that you re enjoying what you re doing and want those around you to recognize it i really enjoy my memories that involve laughter and when I think of those memories i always laugh again i think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life you don't have to spend money or drive somewhere there is virtually no expense its timeless simple fun,50

12787,caPS You laughed today Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives caPS You heard the saying laughter is the best medicine caps comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better cLose to the idea of caPS Laughing has been said to relieve stress and makes you seem more approachable to someone you mONTH not know yet The quote lAughter is the shortest distance between two people is accurate in my opinion i rElate caps TO the way my friends and i act and the way i act towards strangers When meeting someone new making a joke or laughing kind of breaks the ice and can make the conversation more lighthearted and easy wHen i was younger my best friends name was peRSON and we hung out nearly everyday after school We shared everything we had the same favourite colour same hair we even had the same friends We were girls that everyone though were sister because we hung out so much wE were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had Like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together i remember going to lunch like caPS was just the other day though cAPS was easily years ago One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today pERSON was going to get to come home with me and my capS MY caPs kNEW she was going to need to take the car into the shop that day and told us we could tag along and if we were good we would go out to lunch All day we were on our best behaviour because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day cAPS was around lunch time and my capS THought well the car will be a while so I'll take the girls to lunch and then we will pick cAPS up on the way home so We dropped the car off and headed to ORGANIZATION is a local caps restaurant for a caps lunch when we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and i decided caps would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink when caps came to our table i was really excited and i started to drink caps really fast maybe a little too fast when all of the sudden whoosh caps had spilled all over my face and clothes caps was everywhere in my hair on my face in my eyes i was so embarrassed i was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that i started crying right in front of my best friend she was trying so hard not to laugh she had the biggest smile on her face when i looked over my caps was laughing too i was humiliated i was so worried my friend and my caps would make fun of me being so clumsy but they both said that caps has happened to them too after i got cleaned up i realized how silly i had been i was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me but when i thought about caps i would caps laughed too the whole car ride home we giggled about my little drink disaster and we could hardly look at each other without saying something about my spill or we would both think about caps and start cracking up again even though at first i though she would make fun of me and laugh at me for making such a silly accident we ended up laughing together and caps made us closer as friends our memories from when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember they silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun to us we were and always will be great friends we are still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring something up that makes us think of that day when we were little girls and we will bust out laughing again i do believe laughter is the best medicine although of course laughter will never conquer or cure diseases or fight off cancers i think caps makes you stronger to take the treatment if you are happy and caps a positive outlook if you caps something to look forward too something you don't want to miSS Laughter can make a siCK Person forgEt about their illness caps can make them carefree and living in the moment i think LAUghter is so much more powerful than we realize so consider this question instead caps you made someone laugH today,40

12789,Its said that laughing is a good part of life its also said that its healthy to get your chucks here and there its sure its good to laugh makes everyone a better person,20
12790,I think laughter is good for a relationships and here is why whEn i First got to capS CAps CAPS i was trying to be myself and make friends oNe day i was in class and caPS came into my class room and came up to me and she started talking to me and I started laughing The she told me that she liked my laugh so she stared laughing like me sO that i would laugh more an caPS felt good knowing that she was making fun of my laugh she was enjoying cAPS she Was trying to get me to laugh cause she thought caps was funny because she had never heard anyone laugh like that Everyone has a different laugh i have two laughs which she found out funny capS was the best day of my life because i was being myself and I know she was not laughing at me every time she hears me laugh she laughs and tries to make me laugh so that she can laugh and we all have a good time for me caps is funny because lots of people don't notice how other PEOPLE LAUGH CAPS FEEL GOOD THAT SHE NOTICED AND LIKED CAPS AND WANTED TO HAve a good time most people when they make fun of someone they say hurtful things caps wanted to make me laugh again i know she was not making fun of me she just thought caps was unique and funny but not a hama you are weird funny but like a org i love your laugh itS cute aND Funny now every time she sees me she tries to make me laugh caps makes me feel good every time she does caps when you are new at caps good to make other people laugh specially when its not at you directly to be honest caps made me feel like people were startling to like me and not knowing me as the new kid but as a human being an actual person and that they say me for me not for what i wanna be or for what people see me as that is all i could really ask for so my opinion is yes laughter is good for relationships caps shows that you have a sense of humour and that there is a actual person inside that body not just bones another reason is caps shows your personalty your real self is not that what people to want people to see them for who they are not what people say there are at least that is what i want that is why i will never forget that class period caps showed me that if i just laugh with other people ill know that the are not laughing at me like making fun of me they are saying that i am funny that is what people want is to see people for who they are the teacher was a substitute for that day and she kept on getting mad at us for laughing but we couldn't help caps because caps was so funny that period i laughed the whole time i was laughing so caps that i peed my pants a little she made fish faces and sounds like she pretended to be a monkey in a tree she laughed how i laugh she did everything to make me laugh caps was so funny caps took up the whole period that is is how much i was laughing i got up and was going to go to the bathroom and when i got back she was still there and i sat down and so she started making me laugh so then i sat down and caps and person came in and there was something in his pocket and i poked at caps and said what is that its caps we all started laughing cause caps was funny caps was is wallet i did not get why they were still laughing when i stopped but then i continued to still laugh because the way they were laughing we all were laughing and then we all stopped at the same time and because we all stopped at the same time we all started laughing cause caps was funny the sub came and stood there by us and we all got quit and then started laughing again i think that the reason why we were laughing was because we were doing dumb stuff i turned around to do my work and then caps spinner me around so that i would start laughing again then i started laughing again caps i started crying i was laughing so caps caps started laughing so caps that she started laughing at the end of the period i had to pee so bad caps wouldn't let me go she just kept ON Making me laugh more and more sometimes just laughing for no reason is the most fun i guys my whole belief is that laughter is one of the best things that a person can do not only is caps fun but caps is also a very healthy thiNg to do,36

12794,I believe that laughter is a healthy way to get a along with someone and have fun I think that the more you laugh the more fun you re having with someone or a group of people one time me and my friend person were hanging out at my house and we literally couldn't stop laughing every little thing was hilariOus to us for some reason iT MAKEs us have so much more fun together when we can just laugh together instead of fighting i love to laugh all my friends call me obnoxious because i laugh all the time i feel like if you re laughing and laughing with someone it makes you closer and its way more healthier and better if you just laugh for example i always want to hang out with person because we always laugh together and have a good time its like when you have a group of friends and some of them you always disagree on something or fighting its never fun if you have a boyfriend girlfriend and you always laugh with her him it just makes you want to be around them so much more because your having a good time fighting just does the opposite have recently realized who my good friends and who are my bad friends laughing is the biggest quality to have in someone the girls i fight with are usually the ones who have no personality and are very negative and are just mad people my friends that i do get along with we always laugh and have a good time the only time have got in a fight with one of my good friends is because the downers always say random stuff that is not true and hurtful so that person will be right there down with you i have realized the more you laugh the more fun you will have and the more people want to be around you have also noticed that my mon and dad are completely different people my mon is a sweetheart who always laughs and i can always have fun with my dad on the other hand never laughs i honestly can not remember the last time i heard him laugh he is such a downer and no one ever wants to be around him that is probably why my parents are divorced you can just tell that my mon has more fun and my dad does not in life you really just have to have fun do what your supposed to do and laugh so really what i'm trying to say is laughing is a important part of any relationship whethEr its with friends family dating just anything its definitely a good quality to have if a person is always happy and always wanting to have a good time i think its how they re raised if you think about it i get my mon percent of the time and my dad percent of the time whenever i'm with my dad i'm always in a worse mood i never want to do what hers asking i basically want to rebel when i'm with my mon i literally do the opposite i'm always happier and will do what she wants and we always laugh and have a way better relationship then me and my dad do i think laughing and being happier has a lot to do with who you look up to and how they act and what they do i can deFinitely tell my mood change from parent to parent it has a lot to do with how the parents are raising their kids i think as a adult you need to be a positive influence on your kid teenager i think its good to have a healthy laughing relationship with your kid life is to short to spend it hating someone i believe you should spend yOur life havIng a good time and fulfilling yOUR DReams and mostly laughing,31
12795,wHen i was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my caPS Was born and raised and where my caps LIVed i beinG a determined third grader was angry and told them that i would Not move and even sat on the floor and told them that i was noT going needless To say i did not get very far but i was stilL not happy about being moved from my friends and my caps is sidE OF the family that i had been Around since i was littlE My friends were all I had known through my years in elementary school and I was no where near ready to say goodbye to them It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on wE moved three hours away from my hometown it was a pretty big move especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else being a new student is never easy especiAlly with a shy quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one i remember it very vividly I walked in with my cAPS and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change wHen class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself I have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself i can not even do that very well today and I am way less shy then I was back then It was very terrifying to say the least even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person I am did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch At lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses like myself came and sat with me Once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing playing and having a real good time And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay mE and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with We sat next to each other in class talked on the phone had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday shE was the first best friend i Had made when i Moved and i Was glad it was her and not someone else Today I am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I at first was shy and not saying much because I know how it feels to approach someone you do not know The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together Without her that first day I am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time tHe rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends it made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in,40

12799,lAughter is one of the best things people can learn to do Laughter is one of the many things I enjoy doing I love how everyone has their own distinctive laugh some are loud and some are quiet almost like a giggle Not only do I enjoy it but I love that is helps me relieve stress which is a major part of relationships mY boyfriend and i met about three years ago Today we have been going out for a year and three months wE met when I was mowing my yard and my neighbour lOCATION brought him over to introduce us to each other I mean she couldn't have brought him over at a worse time i was hot and sweaty because it was eighty degrees out side I had no make up on and I smelled like fresh cut grass what a great first impression huh capS CAps THIS is person SHE SAid with a smile caps timing CAPS I replied with a tone of anger in my voice sorry she said but he said he wanted to meet you and he wouldn't shut up about it I looked over at him and noticed that he blushed a little and I laughed From then on I knew that pERSON and I were going to have something great together Till this day our relationship is stronger than ever and its because we can make each other laugh now don't get me wrong trust honesty communication listening are all still a big part and those are important too but i think that having humour And being able to laugh in a relationship is one of the key things to a healthy and long lasting relationship my boyfriend and i have great sense of humour and we defiantly like to use it in our relationship i could have the worst day of my life and when i talk to him on the phone i know my day is going to change from horrible to fantastic just because i know that within the first few minutes of talking to him and hearing his voice hers going to say something funny and i can't help but to laugh i honestly believe you need a good sense of humour in your relationship if you want it to last wHen you don't have laughter in your relationship it tends to get very dull and boring you can't be serious twenty four seven that is way too stressful since laughter helps relieve stress you will defiantly need it during your relationship so it does not get stressful and turn into nothing but a bunch of fighting and arguing so in conclusion i know your thoughts about what i just talked about might not be the same but i hope after reading this you will be more willing to consider my opinions on the subject of laughter in a relationship based on being able to enjoy and know what laughter is and also how great of a thing it is how it relieves stress if you have a bunch of stress in your relationship try cracking a couple jokes you will be amazed at what a lIttle bit of laughing can do especially if you Want to keep your relationship with your significant other happy fun and not only that but Also full of Life laughter is bliss,37

12807,lAughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends lAughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter mAny times my family of four departs to go camping during the daTE Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations a couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends I experienced and learned what true rich laughter could do that changed my life whEther i Learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire playing little practical jokes on each other or just some old friendly card games of hearts I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating to set up their tent They managed to make a nUMB minute task take two hours bravo to them The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first only to then turn it inside out second What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humour The boys however did not think it was quite so funny however by tIME fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us Wake up call rolled around at about four in the tIME for us two girls in a non sound proof tent We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other wE found out later that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent It was game on after the boys pulled that prank iTs hard for guys to get you back if they re stuck in a tent A zip tie would do the job iN the middle of the tiME sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back one of our co partners went and told the guys our plan thE three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first The next tIME my friend and I woke we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do Our zippers were tied together and that is not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us barely letting the knife out of our reach When I finally had hold of the small blade I ripped open the zippers gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room When I got back to blood on the ground i found that it was not as gentle of a toss as I thought it was The same guy that gave us the knife to use put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife oNce he was home his mon took him to the hospital to get stitches cAmpfire that tiME Was a hoot Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead tIME Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because were laughing so hard My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that tIME it Was the time together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing with just being our self is and expressing without trying to impress lAter as were all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for Laughing brought us closer together we were not friends before and now after our times shared were exceptionally close best friends Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together by the tIME spent together by harmless little jokes played on each other by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful,46

12809,For my family laughter is important to us because it just means that my parents are not fighting that day i was about nine years old and it was the week of date my parents had been fighting all day for me it seemed like it would never end usually date was what i looked forward to all year but now i just wanted it to be over i hated seeing my parents fight because it always scared my little brother my little sister was too young to know what was going on but whenever they started fighting around her she started to scream and yell when my parents fought i tried to keep my brother and sister busy but that never kept me busy i still heard everything they said and it seemed to never stop my sister was about one year old and when my parents fought she came into my room a lot because it was the farthest room from where the yelling was going on we would watch caps and play games until it stopped once it went on for so long that she fell asleep in my room and i ended up taking her to her bed that night there were so many times where i wished my parents would just stop fighting and realize that it not only makes them upset it made all of us upset well the day before date eve my mon was at work and my dad had to go to work too since my mods work does not allow kids to be there my dad took us along i could tell he had been up late because he had dark circles under his eyes and he had forgotten to shave that time since we were all on break from school my whole day was spent making sure my little sister did not get into mischief or get hurt i had fun at my dads work because i loved playing with my little sister my sister still wobbled when she walked so it made me laugh when we would play tag because she could never run fast enough and it made me laugh just to see her try she loved it too because walking now gave her so much more freedom but she got herself into a lot more mischief now on days when my dad did not have much to do he would have me help him try and teach my brother how to ride a two wheeler it was a lot of fun seeing my brother try new things and have fun with it it made us all laugh that day because he was so excited and happy that he could do something that he couldn't do before when date eve came my parents agreed to stop fighting for the next few days because they wanted us to be happy on date time except that night they had a really big fight after they thought all of us had gone to bed i had stayed up that night really late cause i was watching a bunch of my favourite caps movies i had just turned the caps off when i heard them yelling i did not get much sleep that night because of all the yelling and screaming luckily mY BRothEr and sister were already asleep and i did not have to worry about them the next time i did not know what to expect from my parents everything was how IT Normally was on date time there were gifts under the tree and stuff in our stockings my brother came in and woke me up and said that everyoNe was out in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed i got Out of bed put my robe and my slippers on and went out to the living room what i saw when i got out there was not at all what i had expected my brother was sorting the presents so that everyone had their own pile my dad was laughing at my sister who was trying to pick up a presents that was as tall as her and my mon was in the kitchen making everyone favourite breakfast chocolate chip pancakes bacon and sausage everyone seemed so much happier then they had been the last few days as we all ate our breakfast and openEd presents i realized this was the first time in a while that my parents have not fought it made me really happy to see them getting along we all laughed and had a great time that date time the rest of the day was great too laughter is still a big part in my family even though My parents are separated now its a lot better now because we have a lot more moments of laughter and being happy then bEing upset and having to lISTEn tO them fight all the time now that we are happy and laugh a lot more being at home is a lot better i really do believe laughter plays a big part in any family,35
12810,Many people believe that laughter is a key part of any relationship There are many times when even the slightest laugh is needed to break the tension or even just relieve some stress every once in a while iT is often said that laughter is the best medicine and also the cheapest lAughter is easily found and common to come by in my case laughter comes naturally to my sister and I and for no particular reason at all it not only saved but it built our relationship to what it is today wheN we were younger my older sister and I did not get along very well at all sHe would always tease me then laugh about it and i tOo would laugh at things that she did not find humorous in any way shape or form thIs constantly caused conflict and many arguments between the two of us therefore we hated each other and in a sense wanted nothing to do with each other as my sIster and i grew Older and wiser we started to become much more alike wE still made fun of teased antagonized and pulled childish pranks on each other but instead of getting angry we would just laugh about it instead As we continued to make each other laugh we found ourselves getting along so much better sOon after that we began hanging out more and more and just for the fun of it not because our parents told us too Before we knew it my sister and i were best friends it Is rare to hear about siblings being best friends I am lucky to be able to say that my older sister is my best friend Personally I feel that laughter has played a huge roll in the relationship between my older sister and I Now we depend on each other because we both know that no matter what we can always make one another laugh and virtually cheer each other up We hang out when we need to get away or when we have something that we need to get off our chests We know we have each other for that because we know we can always laugh about it in the end,40
12811,lAughter is an interesting emotion itS one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous this however is not always the case some people laugh when they re embarrassed or uncomfortable others when they re enraged and upset and then there are people who laugh when they are grieving or sad people don't expect that to happen to laugh when you are depRessed it is strange but true i know this from personal experience which led up to one of the most tragic events of my short life i was about nine the age caps you re hyper and energetic almost nonstop i had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door my mon was waiting for caps inside caps on caps she said were going to see your grandparents for a few hours i was upset i was not only tired and hungry but i had to drive almost an hour away to see my grandparents so i did what any nine year old would do i cried whined and pleaded her not to go she did not listen of course she toned caps out waited until i was out of air and then picked caps up and tossed caps in the car is not taking a nap great that is exactly what i did on the ride over i was clapped out so i felt it was alright to have a little caps time when we got to their house i had just woken up and did not feel like moving i had to force myself to get up and say hello it was depressing yet fascinating really seeing your grandparents is like seeing a glimpse of the future in the sense that you know what your going to look like when you re old they had candy though which was tasty and mouth watering we actually stayed for quite a few hours my mon called my dad a couple of times asking if we could go home but we never did she just had a conversation with my grandparents while i watched television at last my dad finally called to say we could caps home we said goodbye and booked it before it was too dark out by the time we got home it was pitch black outside we still had not eaten yet and i was starving i jumped out of the car and walked over to the gate that separated the front yard from the back i shook the gate expecting three delighted dogs to run up and start jumping on the gate wanting to play instead only two showed caps is caps i wondered i thought he was most likely eating or sleeping so i decided to just go inside and eat when i opened the door to the house both of my parents were standing in the entry way i could tell they were trying to hold back tears then it hit caps like a ton of bricks caps passed away my mon said i froze i did not believe them i couldn't my best friend in the world was gone i cried for hours possibly more i did not know what to do then something weird happened i started to laugh i don't know why i did maybe its becauSe i wanted to try to cheer myself up or maybe i realized he was in a better place to this day i still feel an empty space in my heart caps my best friend once was i still think about why i laughed that day i think about why we laugh in general whether its when you re happy angry or even sad we laugh to try to get by and make the best of both good and bad situations as tragic as the situation was i can't help but feel happy My best friend was in pain and could barely walk so we had to euthanize him i knew it was the right thing to do and quite frankly i don't think i would have felt better if I had not laughed that night it was awkward at first it felt wrong and terrible but it helped caps more than i could have ever anticipated,45

12814,Laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons You can get to know someone by what they think is funny show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly I think the quote lAughter is the shortest distance between two people is extremely accurate for most I have many memories of laughter with my friends family and loved ones around me I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them When I was about six and my brother was about nine we did not always get along being the typical brother and sister that we were we both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times when we did get along we usually had so much fun ended up rolling around laughing together and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house tag bored games and our favourite thing of all was tickle monster sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people was not very fun at the time he usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories when the three of us got together and played games i felt like i was on top of the world and i was really happy at that point in my life my favourite time that i can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink under beds and in closets we couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into eVen for a little kid my dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors he was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him one of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like we were inPatient little kids so we did not usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to then we ran down our stairs turned the corner ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door you could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid he started to chase us around the house we were not expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breath eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever my brother thought we should hide under my parents blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target For my dad the tickle monster by the time he was done tickling us our faces were red we were out of breath tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing trying to breath trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out my dad eventually got us out tO the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our belly full and as happy as coUld be that was a really fun memory i have with lotS of laughter and good times to me laughing is a big part of getting to knoW someone and strengthening alReady existing relationships it puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy,41
12815,Laughter is the expression of being happy being able to be yourself around the people you care about and expressing your feelings aNyone can share laughter with anyone even if someone you done know very well or someone you have known for a long time and done talk anymore make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them lAst year my close friend locATION and I were together all the time almost everyday We always make other laugh at the silliest little things even if no one else understands what we are talking about We can make laughter out of any small thing We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around there she is sleeping with drool coming out of her mouth The room was quiet i was trying not to laugh really hard i started giggling I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face iT was so funny i Couldn't hold it in anymore She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at then she started laughing too She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from ORGANIZATION and we heard one girl say to another girl is that all you do is talk crap about your sister capS GIrl was not a regular girl she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip which made the whole thing even more hilarious loCATION and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there wE started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her we laughed about that for the rest of the year Every time we saw her after that we called her girl with purple hair because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd stiLl to caps day laugh every once in a while about that situation A few weeks later after cAPS had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were I did not know any of them but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman loCATION gives them a dirty look and says he definitely down graded since I dated him There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him She was not even pretty at all sHe had a short hair cut but her hair was all greasy it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her you could see half of her upper body just exposed there iT was really trashy We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her loCATION looked at me and we both starting laughing i am not really sure what she was laughing at because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over lOCATION is former boyfriend The next day we were in cAPS capS CLass and i maDe a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble of rit but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me hE said caPS Student has a problem with me calling him stupid I have had lots of issues with cAPS person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnoxious and I also explained everything else that happened earlier The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh also to get me through anything that i am going through,36

12820,The cAPS inspirational caps CAPs oF CAps i cAPS thE cAPS of caps PERson whAT Is caps exactly sOme might say caps THAt is obvious caps is a sound emitted from a person when they think something is funny that is as good a response as any other and certainly quite believable but i believe laughter has a much deeper definition a definition that can only be explained through a marginally humorous less than inspirational story about my experiences as a caps caps caps basketball player this year as a high school sophomore i decided to do something id never done before go out for the basketball team i was inspired by a longing to become more involved in the school district and to be able to exercise throughout the rain drenched winter months in which caps took place having only picked up a basketball in order to steer clear of the sit outs zone in middle school location my performance at early practices was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun and at least they get a calculator naturally the year i decided to give basketball a shot the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be plucked from the team with joyous abandon through sheer force of determination i improved enough in our first few weeks to be deemed better than dirt by the coaches narrowly avoiding losing my spot on the team in the months ahead i would learn that my job wouldn't be making baskets and stealing balls as astonishing as caps was my ability to imagine myself playing basketball far surpassed my actual skills on the court i soon found that my place on the team wouldn't be aggressively runNING up and down the court fighting for control of an orange ball i would be on the sidelines cheeks firmly planted on thE bench upon which my teammates would take breathers before going back into the action our team could play basketball but not often on the same level as The Teams we faced as each game came and went I could see the fighting spirit fizzling out of my peers eyes their morale was simply dropping and no amount of my ball playing abilities could change that caps was one game in particular when i discovered i did not have to play in order to help my team caps was a home game in our lower gym we were down by about numb points against a team we had fared caps against previously needless to say players were becoming very frustrated one of our star players person was becoming so frustrated that our coaches decided to pull him out for a breather he was raging spitting profanities he dropped himself on the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus his mon came down from the stands to give him water which only made him embarrassed him more sitting beside person i could feel the anger radiating off of him he was ranting under his breath over number numb the opposing teams point guard i noticed that while numbs fast legs and swift hands made him a great ball player his voice a good octave above his teammates was much more caps suited for covering organization songs than calling out plays i turned towards person tapping him on the shoulder and informed him of my insight he looked at me for a moment a mixture of anguish and don't talk to me or i will murder caps on his face before bursting out laughing clapping me on the back he saID With a smile caps always know caps to make us laugh person suddenly caps dawned on me that my banter and dripping sarcasm was quite often the one thing keeping smiles on my teammates faces i was able to use caps to diffuse tense situations and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive manNer we lost the game in fact we lost all but one game the entire season and so i made caps my personal duty to keep the entire team in good spirits even in the worst of times as the weeks WENt by i started to feel more and more an integral part of the TEAm making teammates laugh kept their miNDS clear of anger and frustration and allowed them to play to the best of their abilities and so caps was some players had quick hands others had a flawless shot me i made people laugh i gave my peeRs my friends the ability to see light in even the most dire of situations i did not rECEive an award a recognition of athletic ability instead i Found the satisfACTION of making people smile of watching the enraged despair on their faces disappear replaced with optimism and hope laughter is what pushed my teammates past anger to be the best they could be so caps tell me is laughter simply noise that a person makes when soMething is funnY OR is caps something more spoiler alert caps is Much much more,55

12826,lAughter is the most important part when you meet other people Even a light smile can change the image of whole person sOmetimes people practice their laughter to get better image of themselves I believe that every people contain their own personality in their laughter How you laugh is the way to express how you feel For example you can tell you are not comfortable by chuckling nervously or you can tell it was not actually funny sarcastically by laughing without any tone or emotions like a robot you can tell lots of things with a laughter usually friendships are made automatically when two people have something in common and agree with each other and a laughter is the best way to agree with somebody else as an caps i had very hard time expressing my emotions with my laughter as i know many caps people don't know that caps can't smile as well as white people because their facial muscles are not very much developed that is why other people think caps are always angry and does not like humour thanks to that i had lots of misunderstandings about My laughter when i laugh i don't look like i'M laughing which makes an unnatural laughter when i first got here it was in middle of semester and i couldn't speak caps as well as i do now i had no friends at all it was a really hard job becoming a friend of someone without knowing what they know or what their sense of humour is in location i usually made friends by making them laugh but in here i did not know how to make them laugh i had to listen to them quietly what they were laughing about and i had to figure out what kind of sense of humour they had finally when i made one friend i still couldn't laugh i did not understand any of words what they were talking about i did not know when to laugh and where to laugh it seems quite silly when i look back then right now but i was really serious i really missed location where i had friends i can understand and laugh together living without sense of humour made me very depresseD i suddenly stopped laughing at all because i thought laughing alone would look stupid i kept searching about this cOuntry IS CultUre and i tried to watch television more to learn what they have in their heads and tHen i finally understood those slang words they used and i could laugh when other laughed i was really happy i was so happy that i could make other peoPLE laugh i made lots of friends and i laughed with them but i still couldn't understand some of the language or some other things they laugh about but i just laughed when they laughed it made me feel i was one of them when i laughed with them and i was really happy about it there was a research about laughter and life and it said that you live longer when you laugh more they say that even fake laughter CAN fool your brain and it can be healthy then i saw a doctor who can cure people only by laughter there are some groups of people who laugh together to be healthy they gather around and starts laughing it was really strange when i first saw that group on caps but i saw peoples effort to be healthy i figured that fake laughter makes everyone happy and laughter can cover every persons mistake I ALso figured that there are still many ways to laugh in this world by a small laughter or even a fake laughteR we can make a better society and live a better life,34
12827,Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my cAPS tell a very good joke I believe that its important to laugh because it just feels good it makes you feel that everything is going okay With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your cAPS wheN you are feeling down who is there to support you your caps ARE and what they try to do is to make you laugh My best friend pERSON and I have the tendency to always laugh especially if we have a class together its all about laughter we have fun in class we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others our teacher from sophomore year person always told us that were very giggly and that it was a good thing she also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class for example that year we were studying vocabulary and when person and i saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the to show caps every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt her face would turn as red as a tomato and i just couldn't even say a word even now that were juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if i'm standing up i will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something now that is when my caps start laughing more because they say i'm hilarious person and i are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun some teachers appreciate that we actually have fun in their class but others just don't like it at all like last year in caps caps our teacher person completely freaked out because person and i were laughing we were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he did not like it to us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but person decided to make a siTting chart well you would think THAT By having a sitting chart person and i wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that did not happen that did not stop her or me from talking to the people around us we would talk to them and we made class fun when he thought that we were not paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly even though person and i were sitting far aWay from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word every day when my caps and i eat lunch at school at our usual spot were always laughing people that don't really know me think i'm crazy or weird but i say that i'M JUST myselF and that i'm very optimistic person and i say caps sad pandas today we say that when we see that one of our caps is quiet or looks sad the most weirdest thing is that when person and i laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh the first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe its important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved Even if you re having a really bad day like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile,46

12829,aN argument is defined as A discussion in which disagreement is expressed in many cases a proverbial caPS Is created between the two conflicting parties withoUt a way to bridge this gap the two groups or individuals will not come to a settlement and continue arguing until one or the other backs down and accepts the others point of view lAughter can serve as this bridge tHe door slammed shut and i went straight to my room i Had returned home from what had started out as a good time with one of my oldest friends Looking back I do not remember what it was about all I knew was that I was not going to speak to him ever again but being as young as i was these such thoughts rarely last I would see him every day during the school week but it would not matter whether he was there or not he was absent to me as long as we fought This seemed like a good plan to completely ignore each other until we had calmed down but as with any plan things never go quite as well as you want them to especially when you are in the same elementary school and in the same class in eLementary school or at least in my case there were many group activities and when you are paired with the person whom you are not on the best terms with things become difficult wheTher it was to build something write together or solve a match problem as a group communication and teamwork are both important and us fighting did not effect the group well We would each discuss the best way to go about performing the task at hand with another member of the group with whom we were not fighting with and then they would discuss and consult each of us separately in short it was a mess and much more difficult than it should have been oUtside the classroom the fighting persisted at Recess we would not agree to be on the same team or even be on the same side of the field as one another After about a week of this I realized this needed to stop aT recess I tried to get him to talk out our problem instead of shouting at or ignoring each other thE calm resolution to the problem started out well but being children ended in a shouting match to which i losT I began to wonder if we would ever resolve this wHen i got home that day my mother being a mother and always knowing when something is wrong asked me what was bothering me I was resistant at first to explain things but being a mother she talked me into telling her She started to go on about how I needed to be the mature one and that we needed to calmly talk out our differences which i had already tried I began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech bY the time she was done all I had received from the lecture was that I needed to try again The next day at recess I searched for him with the intent of resolving things today no matter the circumstances When I found him and attempted to talk things out it once again turned into a shouting match Nearby friends started to crowd and we kept at it sUddenly in the midst of the yelling my friend with whom I had been fighting with for the last few weeks began laughing I was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter Looking around I saw nothing out of the ordinary only a few snickering bystanders I ran what had just occurred back through my mind Just as I reached the point where he started laughing I had realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other This realization caused me to laugh and everyone else nearby to laugh aFter we stopped laughing we sat down and talked things out like we should have done from the start We questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this After about five minutes of talking we agreed to still be friends and that we would try to talk things out in the future before shouting at each other wHen a teacher blew a whistle and recess had ended I walked back to class feeling happy and relieved that we had finally worked things out and could continue being friends If I had not made that joke in the middle of our fight I am not sure if we would have made up even in the event we realized how pointless it was Laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you However laughter can create a bridge across the caPS and provide a common ground in which problems mONTH be solved,41

12835,A time when laughter was one element or part was when my brother showed a youtube video to my family The video was about a guy who was talking about his childhood when his dad told him to go to the store to get bread to make sandwiches for dinner and was told to not to get into any trouble To avoid getting into trouble his dad told him to go across the street because there was three boys down the block that looked like trouble So he did what his dad told him to do and he went across the street but when he was passing the boys they stopped him One of the boys yelled out something and a bunch of their friends came flying from a that was barbershop across the street and surrounded him He managed to get free and ran as fast as he could He said that he was running so fast that he knew that he passed a ORGANIZATION because he said he was behind it and then was in front of the car running to get to his house wHen he got to his house he told his dad that he did what he told The dad was only worried about is if he got the bread and the guy was upset that his dad was worried about bread instead of him The way the guy told his childhood memory was funny and even though I was already shown the video by brother the night before we both still thought it was funny and so did my family and we would burst out laughing at times,30
12836,One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs bro bro thiS was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching to we were talking about what we were going to do for the day so we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now spencer mon asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little brother so we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music unlike everYone who uses an ipod i use my phone because then i can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so i'll know it was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of haviNg it so when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while i put my phone on my shirt and my town over both so when spencer got out too use the town he jerked the town out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub that moment i look down and see it and freak i took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the town hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dealing zero and nine so i took the battery out again when we got back to his mods i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and i kept answering its of the next morning his mon asked why we did not use a pot of rice and we starTed laughinG because we freaked out so bad over a phone i forgot all about tHe phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories,32
12837,dATE what a night me aNd my friends we were going to a caps party at our dance coaches work we had to dress up as elves and play with kids iT was fun but after we were done with the party that is when the real fun began after we changed out of our costumes and back into our regular clothes we started taking pictures caps were funny ones cute one and weird ones all kinds of pictures anyways my friends and i did not want to go home just yet so we decided that we should go to some places to take more pictures and have more fun first stop was a school play ground but we couldn't stay because it was late And we were not allowed inside so we decided to go to the discovery park i was driving and one of my friends in the passenger seat was taking pictures thAT Turned out really funny so when we got to the park my friend that waS taking the pictures said caps i drive around the parking lot i said sure we switched spots and off we went she was a pretty good driver but caps was some scary moments that i felt we were going to die a a so she drove around and then went to the stop sign by a main road where she decided it would be a good time to switch back and i was yelling at her caps is a car coming we caps get in trouble but no she did not listen to me she got out so then i had to get out and we were yelling at each other and my friends in the back seat were yelling also not because we were mad but we did not want to get caught and we were having a lot of fun so i get back in the driver seat and we are all yelling get in the car but she laughing really hard saying i wet my pants we all started laughing because we thought she was kidding but of no she was serious she was laughing so hard that she actually wet her pants it was a good thing she had extra pants with her so i had to back up the car so she could change behind this big metal thing as she was changing we thought it would be really funny if we got a picture of her changing so i got the camera and stuck it out the window but it was really dark even with the flash on so the picture did not come out she was laughing so hard that we teased her saying keep it in we still tease her a lot about it even though its been two months when ever we are laughing really hard and someone says of i think i'm gonna pee my pants we look at person and say person knows what that is like we have too much fUn teasing her about things sheds done the next day we go and tell the rest of our friends that were not with us what happened and they all started laughing as hard as we did at the time she was not in the room with us when we told the rest of our friends but when she walked in and we all stopped and saw her it was really hard to keep from laughing now everyone knows about that night and person is accident every now and then we make fun of her but she laughs along because we all know it could have been anyone of us it still makes me laugh today not as MUCh as it did back when it really happened but you caps still get a laugh on it every now and then,35
12838,a caPS Caps FOR me laughter is a huge part of life i cannoT nor wish to escape it caps is fuN IN itself It always makes tense situations become relaxed and enjoyable nO feeling is more perfect than falling head first into uncontrollable laughter capS IS the best way to unite people together and form memories and bonds in my home and family too many situations arise that cause the potential and often result of laughter it is the same way with my distant families such as my friends at school life growiNg up with a brother wonderfully fun neighbours and cousins have produced most of my cAPS memories one such time in which laughter flowed freely happened rather recently the siTuation began when my brother person hAD TO do a school assignment person was aSSIGNEd by his history teacher to write a diary entry as if he were a mountain man in the date is I did not set out to help him with his homework but considering the end result i Was thoroughly glad i Did It seemed so unlikely that this task would be so fun I guess that just shows how laughter can crop up so suddenly and in such unpredictable places i came into peRSON Is room and he told me what he was working on so I leaned over his shoulder and helped him with a few ideas We were making progress and once reaching a certain point we both contributed to a subtle humorous comment we decided to add to the entry reAding our creation nothing less than an explosion of laughter was triggered tHe noise poured out of peRSON Is room like lava from a volcano My parents could hear us and likely thought we were crazy Another person reading our literature might not have laughed at all but to us it was hilarious beIng in a good mood and considering persON Is history teacher said to make the entries creative more humorous and quite witty sentences were added By this time I was doubled over struggling to speak through all the cAPS i Was consumed by persON WAS hardly better Homework had cAPS been more fun We finished quicker than if pERSON was working by himself and came away with the greatest feeling peRSON Ended up getting full points on the entry when he turned it into his teacher This is just one example of thousands I could think of in which laughter cAPS the moment This particular instance helped with work and yet cAPS the work not a chore but rather a tremendously happy event Perhaps more laughter in the workplace would lead to better production aLl things considered laughter in my opinion makes for the greatest cAPS,45
12839,I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship In all my relationships whether it be friends family or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them the best relationship i have is with my best friend pERSON and it is filled with laughter We always have a great time together like last daTE when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped pERSON is quad we laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about caps big ears and how they make him look like caps the elephant i think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh the first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing i did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends then she asked me if i wanted to work at the harvest fest with her and i did and a made her laugh the whole time now i'm her doRk and she is my best friend the biggest thing i did to make her laugh at the harvest fest was when i did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of loCATIon in my lip the moral of this story is the more you make people laugh the stronger and closer the relationships you will have whether it be with friends family or a signifiCANT other,33

12844,In any relationship things like physical contact verbal conversations or any kind of outward expression at all is very important More particularly laughing is key as well to any kind of interaction with someone Laughing says what you are saying is funny or I'm enjoying this laUghing says a lot without saying a word Think about someone you know very well iT might be your best friend or it might be a family member If you think about it you can tell when they are mad sad angry frustrated just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes wHen you see them laugh you see happiness Its so obvious because their eyes sparkle their face lights up and you just know that they are cheery Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends bEing with friends is always fun and we love it tHat is why we go do things with them right aNd when we are with them we laugh a lot we Tell funny stories we share inside jokes and fun memories that make us laugh and we love that we love the feeling we get when we are with them and most of all we love the moments that make us laugh Maybe its a long car ride a sleepover or maybe its at a party or church perhaps Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs the rest of the group follows in unison Laughter is contagious making it hard to resist most of the time Whether it be a joke that was told or that someone made a fool of themselves its always a favourite part of any gathering or party or whatever it mONTH be Some people say that each time you laugh a few seconds are added to your life iN not so sure I believe that but I do believe laughing is healthy I know that when I laugh i feel so much better Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends i feel great its like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten and especially if we laugh a lot it makes me feel good When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps what is the first thing most of us resort to iTs going to be making them laugh right Because laughter is a big part of being happy wHen someone laughs they find it hard to resist being cheered up fOr this reason I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all iTs so hard not to feel better when laughing Once again I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company just like smiling at all the right moments or making the right face when they are telling a story and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation iF someone is telling a funny story or a joke laughing shows that you get the humour in what they are saying If you are enjoying being with that person laugh a lot Show them that you love hanging out with them People love making other people laugh Whether you are laughing at a joke a funny story or a face they made or all of the above laughing is just as important in any situation Just like the saying goes for smiling everyone laughs in the same language lAughter says the same thing all around the world laUghter is is almost always a good sign and means something is going right,40
12845,the caps of lAughtER LaughtEr can be used in many different ways you could either laugh because something is funny to be rude or just because you enjoy what people are doing and cAPS brings a smile to your face Sometimes we shouldn't laugh at other people because cAPS could hurt them even more then we imagine and caPS could even affect their life cAPS they grow older wheN i wAs younger i fAced a situation which affected me caps I GreW up I have always enjoyed singing ever since I could remember but up to one point I couldn't bare to sing in front of a crowd or even my family i Was about four years old caps was a dark dATE timE my family decided that we were going to go out to have some fun at a place called ORGANIZATION thIs ORGANIZATION was where family and friends could get together to have a great time there would be a band playing bright round colourful tables to sit at drinks and caPS Had a game room for the children to play at my cOusins and their band were going to playing that time my family and i got all dressed up i wore a beautiful white dress that my mother had chose for me to wear i looked like a star in my own eyes and i was satisfied when we arrived my family and i sat at a bright lime green glow in the dark round table and watched the performance i danced with my parents for a long time and then i would play games with my brother and friends my cousin who is the lead singer of the band was calling out in the microphone if anyone would like to sing a caps to the crowd i ran to my parents and told them that this was my chance to shine and that i wanted to do caps they smiled at me and said yes sweetheart of course you can do caps caps i ran up to where my cousin was standing i pushed through the bundle of children so that i could be in the front i looked up smiled and raised my hand at my cousin shouting for her to chose me my cousin smiled back and picked me up and placed me on the speaker i was so delighted i couldn't even breath caps was my biggest dream to stAND up Here with a miCrophone in my hand caPs i stood on the big speaker box i looked at the crowd of people anD took a deep breAth and i began to sing i was singing my most favourite caps that I knew by memory the crowd smiled and clapped bUt caps soon caps i sang the chorus of the caps evEryone started to laugh i did not know why they WERE laughing was caPs because i accidentally forgot to take my gum out of my mouth because i did happen to forget or was caps because I sounded really bad i was so scared the gum that i was chewing in my mouth started to harden and my voice grew faint i began to panic my eyes started to become watery i noticed tears coming down all over my face i couldn't even bare being up in front of all these people if they were going to laugh at me so i jumped off the speaker ran to my mother and began to cry in her lap i cried for a long hour my family tried telling me that everything was fine and that i did a magnificent job but caps was not enough for me to believe caps over the years i always detested singing in front of people caps scared me just having the thought of maybe someone would burst out laughing because i was either bad or off key after that i always began to tell myself that i had a horrible voice and i knew Caps was the reason Why the crowd at the organization laughed at me every time my parents would ask me to sing a caps i would tell them no thank you i don't like to sing anymore caps was not true at all i lied about caps to my own parents but i still had that horrible feeling in my heart and soul now that i am older i understand why i was so terrified and the reason why the people laughed was not at all what i thought caps was my parents told me that caps was because the people thought that i was adorable and since i was young i couldn't really pronounce some words right i giggled at caps and now i just keep telling myself that i can sing because nothing else is going to bring me down and i am trying to stay positive about caps CAPs is still very harD FOr me to sing a solo but aFter a certain period of time i wilL HAve the strength and couragE to sing to anyone,40

12849,lAugh caPS Caps CAPs caps someone who laughs a LOT or A Little if caps caps the kind of person that can laugh about any and everything then I'm sure we would get along well Laughter plays a key part in my life caPS Is a part in about three different ways in that I joke around a lot about numerous things I do funny things such as make funny faces and last I also laugh about me being a klutz wHen caPS see me or talk to me for either a short amount of time or an abundant amount of time I guarantee I can and will make cAPS laugh Laughter can be an amazing thing when in any kind of situation as in an awkward one an embarrassing time or just any kind of situation when cAPS don't know what cAPS should do just remember cAPS can laugh in those times Ever since I was just a young girl no matter where or what I was doing I always seemed to be a huge klutz mY mon would always say caps CAPS woRSE then a bull in a location SHOP CAPs was so rIGHT if caps was just as simple as me dropping things maybe even breaking glass or falling that statement was always true all caps could ever do when I did do something like that was just laugh because caPS knew that cAPS has a clumsy daughter such as this one time when i waS in elementary school we had award assemblies every month these were to recognize students who had been doing well that month and was following the rules of a certain characteristic tHis was the day i had hoped for my name to get called wheN the teachers were up on the stage calling names i waS anticipating for caps TO Be my turn Then next up my name was called I got up and was so excited and nervous to go in front of the crowd and get my award When I had gotten up there I got my award then went back down the stairs Not a great idea when I was so excited wHen i was going down i Literally went down the stairs my Feet had missed a stair and i weNt flying down on my behind now tEll me what would caps dO IN this situation In front of over two hundred kids and about thirty parents Well I just had to laugh cAPS capS GEt up and go back to my seat aNother thing about laughter caPS really makes me who I am to this day I don't know where or what I would be doing if cAPS were not for me lacking dexterity when I was younger lAughter has brought me closer to my family and friends They know when I am looking gloomy that if they want me to not look so gloomy that they will have to make me laugh My closest friends and I joke around and laugh about numerous things sOmetimes caPS Might be facetious so we have to catch ourselves on those ones From my experience of being clumsy no matter the situation I learned that instead of being embarrassed and not wanting to bring up what happened ever again that making cAPS funny and something caps CAN laugh about is much better Learning from a young age to laugh and have fun caPS Really has made me a better person in that people know me me for many different things but one of them is that i am a happy and funny girl and laugh a lot tHat is something that i am proud of just knowing that I can make my peers and other adults laugh and have good time So therefore laughter is not just one element or part in my life caPS Plays a huge part,36

12851,All the great memories that lOCATION and i spent and shared together when we were really good best friends We were around nUMB years old and in nuMB through numB Grade of cOurse we got older as the years went by but we had so many great times together When ever we hung out we would always laugh about almost everything and most of the time we would just never let a lot of stupid things get to us Whenever I needed someone to talk to she would be the one sHe went through a life that was almost the same as what i went through in life and so she knows what I or even she needs to do or say Even though we would always have lots of fun we would have our moments and fight but always work things out wEd always have each others back for everything i guess what in trying to say is that two people who are close always have their great needs and feelings and especially their laughter in the relationship here are some times that location and i shared and spent together that pretty much led up to laughter i remember in numb grade both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could we were still young so it was hard to do be able to do anything because our parents wouldn't let us most the time whenever we did though we would think about random games and go to different places just to have fun as wE got older though we were trusted more and could do lots more of things which was a good thing then i moved to location not the greatest thing but it was for love what made it better was that she still came over all the time we would go and pick her up on date and then on date my mon would drive to school because my mon still went to work there in florence every night that she was there we would always stay up i remember that i would always keep tHese little hot chocolate packages in my room and after my parents went to bed wed sneak out to go get hot water for it so that we would have hot chocolate to drink some other times we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer it waS hard sometimeS Because my room was right across from my parents room and at the time i had beads hanging from my door fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught sometimes when she came over she would Bring all her make up and things so that we could dress eaCh other up one night we had blind folds on and do each others makeup,35
12852,Laughing is something that everyone experiences iT changes situations from bad to funny itS like magic i mean you don't need a wand Or anything just a twisted sense of humour you just need a little common sense and a little bit of illogical thinking i know that those are two entirely different things but is not that what makes us caps is not laughter just the response to hearing something illogical that differs from your common sense no its not laughter is also an extremely helpful tool you can do a lot of things with laughter you can get out of trouble get into trouble start a friendship end a friendship get a job lose a job win a game and lose a game and that is not everything mind you but i'm not here to talk about all of those things just one of them making friends with laughter just sit back and listen and maybe you all learn something before we begIn the story let me just start by saying that i'm not exactly the niceST Guy on the planet and i know this but i'm good at making people caps its not even on purpose half of the time the majority of my jokes and humour consists of depressing things i honestly think that i geT thAt response from people because they don't know How else to react and this is why caps or caps or whoever invented sadists and masochists anyway lets get back on track once upon a time where teens were desensitized to the harsh reality of modern living there was a kid that kids name was person now i really had not known person for very long and to be quite honest i did not really want to but he tagged along with me and grant and person back in the day he always wore these awesome iron maiden to shirts and listened to the type of music that i liked so i guess you could say it was fated but that is neither here nor there one day we got to talking we were both thinking about this big barrel that had been left in the track at our school it was empty and plastic and when you re numb everything big and red and plastic looks fun we decided that we would take the barrel and stand on it yes that was all we wanted to do with it it never really crossed our minds that we could have taken it or built something with it no the only upstanding conclusion we could come to was to stand on it and we did and it was fun the next day we came to school and person was handing out invitations to his birthday party i was pretty excited so i went as it turns out our lives are very very much alike i think the first thing i noticed when i went to his house was the kitchen it was like they took my kitchen and painted it a different colour and then put it there honestly i thought i was the only kid who lived the way i did i used to get mad because my mon wouldn't ever buy matching dishes or silverware because we never really had the money and this kid had the most random assortment of dishes and such in his house collectible versions of different pint glasses mismatched silverware logical dish placement i know it sounds stupid but it used to make me happy when the other guys arrived we started to talk or at least i did we talked about some random stuff too like caps videos and good movies we had seen recently person and i always ended up talking about other stuff like travel and the future and dogs but that is just because we agreed that newer movies kind of sucked too many explosions and not enough character development eventually we started a fire and moved our conversations outside see it always seems like things are better when you look into the fire and when the fire goes out you want that feeling again well i was prepared to fix it but everybody went inside except me and person another guy at the party so we decided to play around a bit we went into person garage and found his numb and brake fluid we sprayed it on the fire and i think my face got a little sunburned after that the flames had gotten so close to my face that i could feel my eyelashes burning on the tips then we grabbed some more wood and dropped it on the fire everybody came back outside to play around with it i know i'm kind of a bad influence but when life gives you an opportunity to do something fun you can't pass it up we spent the rest of the night talking about girls and cracking jokes i just wish we had a caps caps caps that night i made some eternal friends,36
12853,lAughter one of the greatest gifts in life its what helps you get through the day the year and in the long term your life for me many things can go wrong in a day for example i could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day all i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh it is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else that is why when i moved to location caps i tried to keep a look out for kids like me who loved to laugh and make other people laugh the first days were rough i met a lot of new people that were all the same some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better and that was fine there was one person that i noticed was in multiple of my classes so one day when our caps teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is quickly i looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and i would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner i asked a boy who was in few other of my classes i had not really noticed or even heard him talk he agreed to be my partner we introduced ourselves and he told me his name was person he had a very quite voice i had barely understood his name so i had to read it from his paper we had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually i began by throwing some ideas around person would then say something and laugh but i could never hear what he would say we worked on the paper for a couple of days continuing to only interchange some words meanwhile i was still trying to make at least one good friend i thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time i would have my own set of friends in the meantime i ate lunch with my sister person you would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable it was not though it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger that would work well for both of us until we made some friends after some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on so one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her i hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say maybe tomorrow but no there i was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with if anyone i began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid and i was out of there panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside i paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with then i saw that caps from three of my classes i casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation for some reason i felt relaxed not as if i was trying to make a new friend but as if i was already talking to one in the beginning we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones we could not stop laughing in all of our classes especially auto mechanics we would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could soon we also found out that we watched many of the same to shows we could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said i had noticed this special quality in person that made him extremely funny i was not sure what it was but with anything he said i would just laugh uncontrollably we were laughing buddies but soon we actually became great friends we had really bonded in between the laughter during that time we would find out new things about each other that made us realize that we were a lot alike its been a few months and we have only become greater friends i had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes i knew this was different tho i had made the greatest friend i had ever had now i'm moving and that is the worst part i know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time,40

12861,laUghter in life is a good thing to have i Believe oncE caps I Was numb yEARs old i had a and caps we always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks or go to the beach or go to the parks what was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too maybe not out his dog bowl but off of plates or on a picnic table he was a cute dog he had four little puppies named caps caps popcorn big tail and mountain i named them all weird animal names because that is either what they smelled like or that is what they looked or loved doing why we named my dog caps was because he always smelt like caps i always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog it made me very angry caps he had puppies and a mate i don't know why maybe just because head i really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only my favourite friend i thought in my head hey that is my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him well caps he had puppies i finally realized in my head caps just wanted a life of his own too a family and be a big boy dog he did not hate me he loved me and giving him a family is what i allowed and it made him happy what was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food like caps caps chops or popcorn my favourite puppy was caps caps because that is what he smelt like nOt caps but caps popcorn was a good dog too so was the other dogs but caps caps was a biter its funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew oN stuff the second you leave my puPPIEs aLONE they will so eat everything one tiMe caps we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter and caps we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything i also had caps too but they were not good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up and they stink no not like caps or popcorn but something else gross the puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair they had small teeth but of they hurt stinky breath those dogs had i don't know why but there stinky one of my favourite story about caps was that he never liked to swim it was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs well caps did not know how to swim so i had to teach him myself as a good owner and all well caps ever he doggy paddled he stuck his head underwater and swam forward i don't know why but i always thought can he breatH like tHAT or Is it just a doggy thing well eventually i got him over that i don't think it was good for him to swim underwater like cats he used to never like water it was just a phobia my dog had i guESS but i tried my best to get hiM over it caps i moved around states i had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever but we all move on right laughter i think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life every now and then caps i am sad i just go and think Of caps i had other animals like caps caps caps and cats personally i love cAts more than dogs but caps will always be the first my cats were not really that sociAl to ME There lazy what was so fUNNY about my cats was that i named one of them caps why i named that cat caps was because he was all black but with white feet it was funny because caps ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around he was a wild kitty i named one of my cats caps because he was so fast at everything what was funny about him was caps ever you play around with him he charged off like hE ATe a BOWL of cat nip having anImals in my life to be WITH gaVE Me a story of laughter in my life and happiness laughter i think is a goOD ImportanT PArt OF RELAtionships too if you do not laugh in your relatIONShip THEn i believe thaT the couple are not so happy laughter can be good many times but also cAn be a insult too if it means becoming a insult to some people or Even laughING at people is rude having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations And problems YOU encounter in life to be happy you should have laughter,32

12868,wHen i was a young boy i used to laugh at anything i could but as a kid who did not As I got older and grew more I developed a great sense of humour that to my advantage made me a young people pleas or I grew more and more developing a stronger more confident sense of humour I could always remember making people laugh and loving the attention I received from humour aS my body grew older and my humour grew more funny I had made myself more dependent on my people pleasing personality iN addition I then taught myself how to alter my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect It was a step I knew was appropriate to advance my humorous personality i had no intention of loosing my humour so I used it to my advantage i Used my humour to boost my caPS Count to get attention from non accepting peers and to get the attention that I thrived on I had began to be accepted by higher peer groups that used to look down on me and it seemed as if I had a lot of the attention Anything I could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me aNything from rolling down stairs telling jokes making teachers angry which students thought was funny and occasionally destroying things All this just so I could fit into the crowd that used to reject me As I advanced into high school I knew my humour needed work to keep my peers still laughing I just did not know what kind of work I needed tHat was when i started to ultimately loose my funny humorous personality I had then dropped in the peer ranks down to the kids I thought were once called strange i was friends with people who did not always keep their heads up and were constantly down and seemed never positive I was letting people that I called friends drag me to the bottom when I knew I should be more at the top This was my first major downfall in which I had successfully lost my humorous personality oNe of my friends especially brought me down more than anyone else down to a father level of being unhappy tHat so called capS took me down so far that I needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness I finally realized that it was not fun to be someones CAPS who only drags you down I finally broke free of that clutch when she moved i was not mean enough to say I did not wanna be friends with her it was just to hard for me When she moved it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humour I had broke my dark days away and started back on my endless trail of humour It was hard to accept the fact that I had lost my humour for what seemed to be forever and lost my spot in the social bracket which would be hard to regain But after a month of hard work and focus on both school and humour I had got my personality back to normal iNstantly after i regained my humour I began to feel more happy I received more attention and felt like I was back to were I should be although I was just a little lower Back in the saddle of humour back the laughs of my peers back to the smiles and most importantly back to the way I used to be i had to regain all of my humour and personality my tones voices and jokes but it was worth it in a strange way as i Now continue my humour as a junior and I have not successfully lost it yet but there is always a future I managed to turn the best thing I had to the worst I have felt in a matter of weeks then right back up again In the end its not what you have that matters it is what you can do to please yourself and in the end I would not change a thing,41

12872,Laughter Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations a way to express yourself or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations oN daTE The morning of my numb BIrthday i foUnd out some disturbing and disappointing news that day i fouNd out that my mon had passed away when i firsT found out i did Not know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that things were going to be okay I knew they were right but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same aT this time i thought to myself what will CAPS be like what am i going to do on mothers day and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday its hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for nUMB years of my life is gone but since my mon has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school becoming successful and not letting my life spiral down hill Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mon wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter gRowing up my mon always told me that laughter is the best medicine And after losing her I realized that that statement was true Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mon and laugh about the good experiences and times we had and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mon has passed away and I hope it continues to help in the future but I continuously think that sure I can laugh about things now but what about in ten years I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful and even if laughter does not always work for me i will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way i would if i still had my mon it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there but fortunately i am not dealing with any of this alone one person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt she has been in my life since day one my mon and i even lived with her i am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life if she was not i don't know wherE i would be right now she has taught me that i can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because i don't have my mon but to liVe life to The fullest and live the life my mon would have wanted to see me live she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and i am very happy i have someone to go through this with having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me knowing that i hAve someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that i have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and i think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care aBout you around in some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do but the best advice i can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends,40
12873,Every one laughs i love to laugh in fact that is one of my favourite things to do If your in a bad mood or just cant get happy laugh at things cause i am sure it will lighten up your mood and i will tell you what its also very good for you in many ways iF people did not laugh then this world world would be a very depressing you smile at someone who is not the happiest could totally change their mood So as i have told you before i am a very happy and energetic person and laughing is what i do best and i smile at everyone around me well i have a story for you i like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks home cause i believe i should share my happiness with everyone else around me it makes my soul feel good to help people out This one after noon i was doing what i do best laughing and having a good time at the old folks home making people smile they all love having me around cause they say i cheer them up I run around room to room bringing in vases of flowers opening their curtains to let the beautiful sunshine in i always told them vitamin CAPS is good to warm up the soul There was this one man there who had never have a smile on his face and i did the same to him as i did to the other residents and no matter what i did he would never smile When ever i came in he was always gazing out the window with a dead look on his face so i had ask the nurses why he was so grumpy and quiet and they had told me he was a veteran hE did not have much family from what i understood or well at least they did not visit him much they just dropped him off cause they did not want to deal with the grumpiness any more but i have a heart of gold and i feel like i should share I had decided one day that i was going to turn that frown on his cute little face upside down and make him feel happy and smile and interact with the other residents sO as usual i went in and did my daily routine to all the other rooms we talked did some laughing and all sorts of stuff I had saved the little old man for last i was not sure what his name was or what the what his whole background was like but i was going to go for it i went in and he was staring out the window as usual i hesitated for a minute cause i did not know how he would react So i went up and started talking to him i introduced a self but he did not seem to pleased I asked him his name and he told me it was none of my business and that totally shot me down made me feel like i was the bad guy So i started talking to him and asked him about his life he had slowly opened up to and told me about all the stuff he had seen in the LOCATION war He turned out to be a nice guy all those nurses were wrong about him they did not even try wE laughed for hours me and him and it did not get old Ever since i talked to him he has been progressively started interacting with the others they just did not give him the time of day to explain his feelings or someone to talk to So think about it next time your going to the store and you see someone who does not look like they re having the best day and shot them a smile,36

12875,lauGhter Laughter is the shortest distance between two people unknown This quote has a lot of meaning to a lot of of people I am one of those people that believes that this quote has a ton of truth and meaning The best true story that I could tell you that involves me and laughter is about my dad and I wheN i wAs little and still living with my dad my mon fought with my dad all the time and neither one of them where ever happy my daD and mon both had good jobs but they never had money to do anything because my mon loved spending money and got them both into dept mY dad had to sell stuff of his all the time to help pay off all the dept My parents got divorced with was a good thing for us all i got to hang out with my dad and i found out how much fun he is and how funny he can be my dad and i started going hunting and all sorts of stuff like that i found that my mon is even worse when she is happy because shE gets vary hyper and loud or you could just say annoying she gets me to laugh every once and a while but its always at her rather than with her i love being with my dad because i always have fun and learn something that will be vary helpful to me i think that laUghter is important to have in any kind of friendship if you pay attention to how you are around the people you like the most you will see that most of what you do is make each other laugh,28

12878,Laughter to me is the best medicine there is and indeed a big role in any good relationship iTs especially good for a couple who is serious and has forgotten how to laugh Also for those who could use their mood lifted I know that laughter made my relationship so much better In the beginning my relationship with my boyfriend was not so great We barely laughed with each other let alone spoke very much Only with friends would we laugh and have a good time tHough we were not much of jokers anyway All we could do was get upset or just not say anything Even if the joke was funny weLl that all changed one night when we decided to go to the locATION and play a few rounds of CAPS When we got there we were kind of moody and I was very short tempered aFter we sat down the mood lightened a little Then we finally got to talking and then one little outburst sent us practically rolling on the ground We were cracking up Faces red and gasping for air wE laughed so hard we almost cried and the jokes did not stop Our moods totally changed once that happened We couldn't even remember why we were upset Almost like the anger just vanished Soon after we realized how ridiculous we were and that its alright to joke around just so long as its not mean laTer on we went to a friends house and had an awesome time We told a few good jokes laughed an awful lot and really had fun Then when it got dark we decided to go home and were still cracking jokes I don't know what it was about that night that but for the first time in a long time we were smiling and happy Sharing that experience allowed us to really connect with each other Not only that but it strengthened our bond and brought us closer Our relationship has been great ever since then We can laugh and have a good time without being so serious all the time I know now why laughter is very important in a relationship Despite our little run in with moodiness all that joking around reminded me that laughter is by far the best medicine there is It did some things that others never could sOme moNTH not think that laughing is best but i believe it is Those little giggles every now and then mONTH not seem like much but believe me there is so much more than you think Laughter is everything to me After what it did for me and my boyfriend i don't know how i would live without it,40

12880,To me laughter shows the importance of life I have always felt that in any situation whether cAPS or bad laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations wheN it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it lAughing has always changed caPS Mood and helped me through situations When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the cAPS things in life and begin to lose your patients with each other this has happened to me a lot a Time this happened to me was when me and capS boyfriend were on our way to lOCATION and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong wE went to loCATION for a vacation away from our hectic home lifers and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were they had over booked our hotel our car broke down caps credit card account was being help for numb hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made there was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight we ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had the next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each OTHEr he ended up leaving for tHE day and we did not talk time when he came back but even when he got back after not being together or a day it was still hard being around each other the next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and have had morE then enough the only thing we did was mope around and fight this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation there was no one we knew around to loan us money no banks only an caps and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare we had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a caps vacation and had given up on each other we were done wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore this nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore but more as two people who completely despised each other the next day i decided to call caps bank and see what was going on with caps account it turned out i forgot i changed caps pin number to access caps account the entire time i kept entering the wrong pin so they locked caps account to be sure someone was trying to break into it i could not even describe how dumb i felt i knew that as soon as i came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright they wouldn't when i arrived back at the hotel i could feel thE tension as soon as i walked into the room i began packinG CAps stuff and when he caught on to what i was doing he asked where I was going i replied to luxury Instantly his face lit up and he asked how and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me I knew as soon as i saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all We finally had the money to rent a car and get to our dream destination When we arrived at the hotel things were going great we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness,36

12883,The thought of seeing him and hearing his laugh never failed to make me smile I was beginning to accept the fact that this was an urge I couldn't fight anymore hIs sense of humour was the best I had encountered and it made my heart run wild tO me the best piece of a relationship is learning about one another and exploring the little things that make that person who they are a trait i always search for is someones humour and when I can easily find it I thrive on it My story takes place nearly a year ago while my freshmen school year was coming to an end i Had a suitcase of new memories i Planned to carry with with me but one more was still to be added i strolled into art class merely nuMB seconds late on a particularly average day tHe musty smell of rain and old paint settled in the air something i Had come accustom to Instinct told me to take my seat so with my headphones blocking the rest of the world out i did i Paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus A voice with a highly sarcastic tone came from in front of me capS TO go you rE late caps the teacher had moved all of our seats i couldn't help but TO Laugh at myself as well however my seat remained unchanged the only new aspect was the people sitting around me i greeted the familiar faces with a smile as class began the teacher went on about art related topics that i was far beyond so by habit i vaguely payed any attention i was far more focused on the person sitting in front of me i had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him we barley said a few words on that day of class as the next day approached i continued my usual pattern of entering the room and sitting in the same place it had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me he turned into the room took his seat caps what i had forgotten made me excited today was a free work day a time to be social and work at our own pace perfect opportunity for me to learn something not related to art i casually introduced myself trying to fit personality into my words his introduction was far less enthusiastic him being uninterested made me thrive to try harder i began to be myself and act as if i had known him for years even though his name was brand new to me it was then i had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing by the end of that day i had not finished any of the work i was supposed to have but I couldn't bring myself to care i had just Met such an alluring new person each day went on similarly but i had taught myself a good balance of work and talk i couldn't get enough of this person i had just let into my life everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in i'm positive everyone in the room knew of how funny i found him because Of how often my laughter filled the room it did not take long for me to become very attached to him aNd each hysterical thing he said after a couple weeks the hour of class was not enough for us and he made the decision to give me a call i intrigued him as well so our time spent talking did not stop at the end of the school day but spilled over into our phone conversations more time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often i no longer needed to act as if i had known him for years it was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me although along with familiarity came a sense of question i was begiNNING TO very well open up to him but Was not getting the same in return i would tell him something of my past and he would make a joke of it i would explain an opinion of mine and he would pretend to have the same i had never laughed so much in such a short amount of days but it was coming time to feel more then pretend hysteria i wanted to be able to tell him personal things but get something from him too i began to realize i was digging deep into shallow waters the amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humour i couldn't connect with him on anything more then simple things i still wished to have him be apart oF my life to still enjoy his company but i had no need to dig deeper it was time foR me find new waters to swim in,43
12884,oNe day on a stormy night i had gone to the wood shed to get some wood The wind was thrashing the trees and all of the coyotes in the distance were barking to the moon i was taking one piece at at time trying to make sure that the pile would not fall on me As I watched my step i lost my footing on a small cylindrical log about a foot long and hit my head My brother came out to find out what was taking me so long and arrived to my body unconscious hE took me into the shop which is connected to the woodshed out of the cold and turned on the furnace to keep me warm in doing so he accidentally locked the door from the outside which locked him and me in the shop As I woke up from my faint sleep with a splitting headache all i could remember happening was the rain pounding against the side of the woodshed caPS was sitting next to me with a sad look on his face and also some shock as well He told me what had happened with the door getting locked and how we would never get out till morning I looked around trying to find something to get the door off but couldn't find out what anything was My parents could not hear us over the storm since they were asleep and we were helpless no matter what we tried So instead of looking on the gloomy side we decided to make some stories and tell jokes to pass the time till it was morning again aS we made up a game called caPS we found that we had a lot of similar interests and also we laughed at the same jokes as we laughed the time seemed to fly by as if we were in a time warp after three hours it seemed that we were both getting hungry and i had a couple snacks in my pockets so we sat by the furnace and ate and told jokes about our friends and our parents and the laughing kept us cheered up for another three hours After a while we started to hear the storm start to leave the sky like a ghost leaving this world to the next life We started making fun of different movies and they re actors and actresses i started talking about how big person is ears were and we both started cracking up with laughter uncontrollably he then came back to me with how big organization is lips were and i laughed so hard i couldn't breath we looked through the holes in the shop to see the morning dew on the grass and birds CHIRPing in trees and i knew it wouldn't be long before we were found as we waited for our parents to come find us we looked at each other and said thank you we both knew by saYING THAT IT was not meant for all the times i tried to get us out of the shop or for caps pulling me into the shop no it was for the time we spent together and laughed It made us closer than we already were and it also gave us a memory of laughter that we spent together instead of a night of disaster and horror We have cherished that memory ever since it happened even though we mONTH fight over the most tiny inconsiderate things sometimes and make fun of each other we know that deep down we do it out of love,37

12891,lAughter is almost always a good thing mainly because when people laugh it means their happy or something is funny It can be very beneficial at times for instance when someone is not feeling to happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to and them laugh laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago fOr instance now caPS we want to laugh we need only to pick up remote and turn on the cAPS we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet sOmetimes people go to comedy clubs to go and see a stand up comedians coMedy and laughter go hand in hand from the very first time someone laughed comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed I remember that when ever my parents would have a new friend over then only thing I would hear when they were at my house was then sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing Soon the new guest was over much more often Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more caPS you have ever noticed men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them tHis and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship I have herd but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not felling so good so it mONTH possibly be therapeutic for me caps this is so than people have been going through therapy for many years Sometimes people laugh even cAPS the subject is not funny they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might fell kind of out of place Everyone has a different laugh some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them my mother has a very loud and high pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh no matter what your laugh is like it can help you feel better it can also help you become closer to someone laughing is just one of lifers greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh,40

12898,lAughter one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world Everyone can relate to it and there is no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing its human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people we are social beings and laughter is the best way to connect to other people there is no negativity in laughing unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment and in general if people are laughing they would say they re having a good time people build relationships around experiences that they have with other people for example dating on a first date its to be expected and an important factor for the two people to be having fun and laughing other wise when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts their impression could make or break the relationship that is why a first impression is so important when the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had if they remember smiling and laughing then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again think about any experience you have ever had with another person if you remember the first time you met them and how you felt afterwards the way you felt then could tell you a lot about how the relationship went meeting new people its difficult but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new and they will usually tell you make them laugh its a universal term anyone can do it this past month basketball season has started and i am playing on a whole different team then i did last year only half the girls on my team last year are still here and i have had to make a connection with girls who are younger then me and who i have not yet gotten to know i start to think about all the new girls and who i have already made connections with and how i'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court no matter how difficult the practice month get you can never become to exhausted when someone is making you laugh laughter is needed in life to make it more liable think about it if you could never laugh again what would be fun about life image life if it were like detention all the time never being able to just let loose relax and have a good time no one would want that people would go insane laughter calms people down and mellows them out it helps create peoples personalities and can affect others as well laughter is like a ripple in the water it starts as just one single person then expands out touching anyone near it laughing is contagious like a caps in mid date and brings joy to you and the people you can touch laughter its the foundation of happiness,46

12901,mY dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit I was nervous in the beginning of course but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel i drove all over town completing some errands we had to do along the way now it was time to go through the car wash my first time in a carwash with me in control i didSt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town but i was wrong aFter having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors Before i could do all that the wash had started aS a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was successful Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam mY dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that want the plan at first I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad He looked back at me not saying anything the car was silent After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter wE had not stopped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation aLl i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident so why did it have to happen to me,35
12902,yOu know when you re talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time daTE when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighbourhood barbecue or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school aNd then you think its so funny that you laugh so hard you cry i Remember days like those you always tend to feel better when you laugh When friends hang out laughter is usually involved To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny Laughter brings people together even on the worst days Everyone has those awkward times when you re talking to someone who you are not having the best of relationship with but yet you have to make due and try to make it less awkward there is also the random joke when someones upset to try to lighten the mood when you get someone to laugh its so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and its easier to talk with less tension have had plenty of days when have gotten into a fight with a friend and have had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking its just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or if they are judging you as you speak but you know they are not when you can get them to laugh because then they are not really thinking badly of you it also helps the tension there is also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you sure there is still tension cause of the fact that they are crying but joking about it or trying to get them to smile or laugh does help distract them and get them in a better mood its said that laughter is the shortest distant between two people and i think that is true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you also if you can have a good laugh with someone they are more likely to become a friend of yours since you know how to make them laugh and its fun to talk to you the more you and a friend can joke and laugh together the more close you usually tend to get with them cause you enjoy spending time with them and you re more comfortable with them and you know them better and also when you can joke freely with someone you can usually also talk freely to them about anything and you know they'll be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to i know that i personally love to hear funny stories i never really have many of my own that i remember i love hearing jokes and laughing with my friends it always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know but most people tend to giggle or smile when Uncomfortable too You know those times when someones having an awkward conversation with you and they ask a question you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you cam do is giggle and smile when they look at you expecting to answer Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you just laugh and keep messing up your sentences cause you don't want to mess up I don't know if laughing when you re uncomfortable is just a way to make it less awkward or because you re too confused on what else to do Sometimes when you get awkward and laugh it can make it even more awkward when they just find it weird and sometimes it helps when they then joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward Even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry iT is also said that is lAughter is the greatest medicine i aLso agree with that because when you laugh you always tend to be in a greater mood and when you re in a better mood you tend to feel better in any way and you also tend to be more positive about things Laughter brings people together in awkward sad good or just normal conversations tHe better you can relate to someone the more you guys can joke together the more comfortable you are with that person yOur day is always brightened when you share a good laugh with a friend a classmate a parent anyone even a stranger It always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days,35

12910,Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self in my opinion Laughing is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing about funny things Laughing also make you feel close too people because once you and that person get to know each other you all just laugh about anything even if its not that funny for example when i first meet people i am very shy i don't really say much but if the person that i am talking to makes me laugh it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke around with them it makes the conversation fun if there is No laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead no one wants to be around a person with no sense of humour in my opinion everyone has a funny side some people like to show it and some people like to keep it to themselves some people might be funnier but the things is we can all be funny in our own way have had many experiences where laughing has benefited my relationship with people me and my friend met in middle school i was good friends with his sister but i never really got to know him until i went to high school i had a lot of classes with him so i started talking to him but because i already knew him i was not very shy the first day that i talked to him at school he was making fun of me but not an a mean he was joking around how i brought chocolates to his house and i did not offer him any it was more of like an inside joke the thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around so i immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think now we are best of friends we laugh about everything and we have are own little inside jokes when i am talking to my friend i can say anything that i think is funny and i know he will laugh at it laughter has really made my friendship with my friend fun one of the best relationships i have with a person is with my sister and its because we jusT laugh all the time when we are together when either of us is going through a ruff time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while even though we are sisters and we naturally have a Bond laughter just makes are sisterly bond ten times better we have very similar personalities and we are both pretty funny so the laughing never stops between us there is always something we laugh about laughing in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship without laughter it would be a miserable unhappy relationship laughing brings out the good side of people in most cases it brings out truth in peoplE when you first meet people laughing really makes conversation comfortable and not awkward starting a relationship with laughter can really make you good friends for example like my friendship with my friend when you are sad or mad it really makes you feel better when you have someone that makes you laugh it just makes everything better it really can change Some peoples mood and make them forget about the negative stuff in their life for a whilE laughter is just a grEat way to bond with people having someoNe to laugh with is just very important to have in life,36
12911,wHen i was about thirteen me and my older brother dissuaded we where going to spend the day fishing i Got out of bed that morning throw on a pair of old torn up blue jeans and when downstairs to get some breakfast oN my way i could smell the sweet aroma of eggs and hash browns that made my mouth water My brother was up and about and had just finished his plate mY mon handed me my plate and and i reached for the bottle of caPS EthAn was sitting across from me as i ate and said We'll leave in an hour or so I said okay and went on eating After breakfast we gathered our poles and tackle boxes and put them in the car along with an old boat we kind of jacked of the old neighbour lady We put our stuff in the van and mon drove us into town It was about eight in the morning so we wouldn't get back home till about three or four in the afternoon depending on how the fishing is There was a little store in town and the creek went right behind it It was a small creek I grew up on it so I thought i knew what to expect wE put in behind the store and our mon left after telling us to be safe it was a chilly datE MOrning and a little cloudy the wAter was cold and my brother said i shoUld wear his waiters i thouGht it was silly seeing as we would be in a boat burt i Put tHem on and we put the boat in the water This was the first time we ever even used the boat so it was exciting As we went down stream the water got fast and loud and the embankment was like a wall to the outside world As we took the next corner there it was a water fall about as tall as a man Not the kind you would see in the movies but it was good enough for our eyes Right in the middle of it was a big rock and water went around both sides of it wE where pushed right up agency the rock and where all most thrown from the boat and we grabbed the rock for dear life We where stuck and I looked at my brother and he kneaded as if to say down is the only way So with that being said we both let go and let the water have us As soon as we let go it was like being of the back of a two thousand pound animal in a rodeo the only lasts a second When the boat sunk my waiters filled up instantly and and it took all i had just to hold on to that boat that was pulling us down stream now We lost all of our gear except the tackle boxes an oar and that stupid boat It took all we had but we finally got the boat out of the water and poured the water out of it and the water out of me i was scared for my life now This was suppose to be a fun fishing trip but it was now a game of survival We couldn't turn back now the only way to got home was to go the rest of the way i Was cold and wet and did not have any options we had to continue so we tried it again just to sink we spent most of that day carrying the boat around rapids and throw brush all day until it mellowed down and we could put the boat back in we got to a big pool so big you could fit a house in it there where some small rapids running right throw the middle of it it dint look bad but with what we had bean in we dissuaded to be extra car full we went around the rapids through the pool as we went we burly braised the end of the rapids with the boat and we went in i tried to keep from sinking but my waiters where to heavy as i tried to swim to shore my shoe fell off and went down stream being stupid a chased after it on my belly to get it the water was faster then i thought as i let it caps me i was swallowing so much water and i couldn't breath i could feel it begin to get deeper and soon i couldn't touch bottom at all my shoe was right in front of me and i finally got to it with burly anything left i got to shore and just law there choking up water after ten minuets i got up and went back i think it was freak luck we survived That day but some how we did i learn a lot that day and laugh about it now,35
12912,it is true that laughter is important in any relationship friendship and in life sometime laughter gets you out of trouble sometimes get you in to trouble but the more we laugh the more we are going to be happy i time that laughing came in handy was in caps scHOOL in the numB grade CAPs person WAS split into a group the popular giRls band nerds hippies and the jocks The lunch room was always how you knew who was who The popular girls would sit with the jocks everyone of the girls had a boy to flirt with the band nerds on the floor making straw recorders and drums out of milk cartons the hippies all in a circle eating salad out of one tray None of these groups ever intercepted each other i Fell into the group of the hippies we wore green everyday and peace signs on as many clothing we were able to get on our tiny little bodies wE were the nicest group we helped with capS CAps friendly activity there was to do We did recycling everyday mY caPS school experiences was outstanding The best thing about our group was that we knew how to laugh we would giggle chuckle or laugh so hard that our mouths were open and we were holding our gut but no sound would come out on A beautiful date TIMe we decided to sneak out of the lunch room why did we I don't know We all just really wanted to sit outside and eat tHe golden rule at lunch time was capS person had to raise their hand to be excused and then take a green card to be able to cAPS outside After you got a green card you had to take it to the outside teacher which showed her him that you could be outside But instead of waiting to get excused we walked all the way around the other side of the building to sneak around to the bright green lawn that was filled with flowers I don't know how we managed to sneak around with no teacher seeing us but we did When we saw that bright green lawn we ran to it like a four year old running to a ice cream truck We all skipped danced and ate our lunches that our momus packed us we all sat in a circle and passed around food the day couldn't get any better in a matter of fact it got worse when we were done eating we went and played on the play ground forgetting that we were not aloud outside in the first place we swung on the swings climbed on the monkey bars we were screaming laughing talking which led to a teacher coming over and told all of us to come to her her voice was calm like she was trying to keep a bear down her throat so it wouldn't come out and eat us we sat there with big bug eyes and all held hands the teacher said we were in really big trouble and there would be really bad consequences and we all knew that before she told us a few seconds after she told us that i just started laughing really hard i couldn't stop it was like someone put a spell on me to never stop laughing everyone looked at me like seriously you pick right now to bust out laughing i was on the ground curled up in a ball with my hands holding my stomach and my face was bright red i couldn't stop laughing finally i got a hold of myself i looked up at everyone around me looking down at me i Looked at the teacher and she started busting out laughing we all sat there in silence staring at her now she was the one on the ground i couldn't even believe it she looked at all of us and said caps have fun it is a beautiful day out and you girls are nice ones i will let it caps this time but just don't do it again we all hugged her and ran off to the swings and monkey bars to this day i will never forget that moment just a simpLe laugh got us out of being in so much trouble who would of thought it is true that laughter is important in any relationship friendship and iN life having laughter in life makes the world caps round,42
12913,lAughter one of the wonderful things that we humans can enjoy lAughter with friends family and with people we do not even know We all can enjoy and share laughter it is one of the amazing things that can bring us together no matter what ethnicity age gender or disability We all can enjoy it together and no one can take it away from us lAughter is simple but yet complex in many ways It is like falling into a pool of cAPS lauGhter just the word laughter brings me joy wHen our days go sour laughter is there to sweeten it up Where would we be without the wonders of laughter lAughter it is like a tool It is the thing that has helped me make new friends aLso laughter has helped me get out of conflicts from both friends and enemies It has also aided me into achieving the things I want lAughter is caPS My middle school years My family and I moved a lot and every time I moved I had to make new friends It got very difficult for me to make new friends every time I transferred to a new school After I have settled down and got used to the surroundings of the new school I then started to make friends I noticed that laughter was a key element on making people like you and then later consider you to be what is known as a friend After I have made new friends and became very comfortable with my school the time to move came again It gets difficult to make new friends but its even harder when you have to leave the new friends you just made behind After moving so much I just got used to making new friends and later on laughter slowly became more like a tool than something that I should enjoy A tool for just making friends After I got into high school I just stopped trying to make new friends because I felt that I knew I was going to make new friends and then transfer to another school and then start all over and make new friends again I gave up trying and decided to get more involved in school and achieve good grades Later in the year I felt like a kid with no friends because I stopped trying I decided to go and make new friends but somehow it became a lot harder to make friends in high school than middle school I tried to be the funny guy like I was in middle school but I just did not have it in me anymore also when people get older the type of humour people enjoy changes as time went by i realized that you don't have to make everyone lAugh so they can be Your friend it was about getting to now the person and to be able to relate and to be a there when they needed you the most making friends at a new school is not easy but it also is not very hard all you got to do is be open to people and let them know who you are this is what i learned about making friends you can't make everyone laugh because everyone has a different taste in humour humour and laughter are different from each other everyone has a different taste in humour but we can all come together and have a good laugh laughter is wonderful it is what puts people in a good mood we as people month have our differences but we can still all laugh together it feels very good when you get a good laugh but its even better when you know that the person who made you laugh did it so you can be happy we shouLd not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our facEs,35

12920,tHe new trimester had started and leadership was my second period wiTh no idea of what the responsibilities of a leadership student were i wAs sceptical on taking the class after days of taking the class i began to enjoy it more and more after a week or so the teacHer announced we would be on stage helping set up and organize the upcoming assembly i had never done anything of the sort so i was somewhat excited days went by and the entire class practice setting up the assembly running to our places moving props and stacking chairs the day of the assembly finally arrived it was time for the show the students poured into their seats as we scurried around behind the curtains everything was set up perfectly the curtains rose and the assembly began my peers and i stood behind the stage watching the assembly unfold the school band preformed a long boring set of songs the curtains fell and the entire leadership class ran out on stage picked up and stacked the chairs that the band just used after we all ran to get the bleachers and dragged them out to the front of the stage the choir was now going to preform we then retreated back behind the curtains the choir sang their songs and we watched but as they proceeded to set up for their last song students moved around leaving a large open spot in the top row with the choirs last song they preformed a simple swaying dance to go along with their song my leadership class friends and i noticed this large open spot in the choir and thought it would be hilarious if one of us went up there and pretended to sing and dance however none of us had enough courage to do it the choir finished their song and dance the first assembly was over we then cleaned up and got ready for the second assembly it was time for the second assembly and everything was going to be preformed again the students came in sat in their seats the band played we stacked chairs and moved bleachers it was time for the choir to come out and sing once more the thought of how funny it would be to go up on the bleachers and dance came upon us once again finally we convinced one of our classmates to do it she ran to the choir room and put on a choir robe put her hair in a funny bun fixed on her forehead and stepped up onto the bleachers she took the open spot in the top row the song began as well as the dance she broke into random dancing not in any way matching up with the other dancing choir members it was obvious she did not belong up there the crowd soon began to realize what was going on laughter broke out in the seats but soon after laughter broke out behind the stage as well i was laughing like I had never laughed before it was painful tears pouring down my face i was gasping for air running out of breath and bracing myself for a deep inhale when right at that moment the song had a dead silent pause the auditorium went completely silent i inhaled in and as i took in that air my body managed to let out an extremely loud embarrassing screeching noise people behind the curtain stared at me i knew that it was heard throughout the auditorium embarrassed i laughed even harder causing more pain tears and lack of oxygen tHe song ended followed by the end of the laughter then by the end of the assembly the girl stepped down from the bleachers and we all scrambled out of the building hiding the robe along the way we laughed all the way to our next period listening to the students in the hallway talking about it giggles filled the school for hours talk of who it was what actually happened and why it happened were on everyone is minds except for ourS the second period leadership students knew exactly what had happened we had the pleasure of telling Everyone in school about the dirtY little details the following days howeveR the teacherS also got word of it not thinking our actions all the way through we would soon have to face the consequences we were told it was irresponsible and child like we had a plethora of possible punishments in school suspension date school a referral an apology to the choir class and loss of the privilege of being in leadership after the school board talked to our parents and gave the event serious consideration we got out of it with having one day of date school and apologizing to the entire choir class the school board realized it was just a joke letting us off easier than it could have been in my eyes the prank was well worth it for weeks on end every night i would go to bed laughing aBout that leadership assembly,44
12921,Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry yOur chest is bubbling with the laughter and tears spilling out of your eyes faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions This is not the forced kind of laughter this is uncontrollable This is pure joy I laugh like this at least twice a day tears and all If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts I swear I would have it If I have a good laugh during the day then i wont be so sad later to come it has made me a much happier person And it has even been able to bring me together with other people ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life thIs was a time in my life where i Worried and would dwell on the past i wAs a deep fourth grader but My friends were much different caps did have their bad moods on occasion and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the cAPS capS Very creative I know tHis caPS was navy blue and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives onE day as we were dismissed to recess four of my close friends and I went over to the cAPS we Watched as the boys ran as fast as caps COUld to the field to get their daily game of football started Almost every guy in the ORGANIZATION would go to the baseball field and play touch football it was the cool thing for the ORGANIZATION studs And sometimes the girls joined in too While we were sitting there sulking on the cAPS a few boys walked up to us caps TO play some football with us we couLd use more people caps said WE were not in the mood for playing football but with the persistent nagging we had to give in the square field was soggy from the organization rain and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys but we managed to score a few points for our team and duck for cover when needed the football lightened our moods and was much better at making us happy then the caps caps so a new tradition was formed every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around we dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball and lunged to tag any person we could get to the caps was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun but one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before it was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field people were slipping and falling constantly and then something amazing happened it started raining all over again but nobody had even thought of quitting we just laughed and kept going the rain blinded us and the slick ground was no help so a collision was inevitable one of the girls picked up the football the ball had been through a lot and now it was covered in mud she had a clear shot of the end zone and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance when out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her but instead of swerving to miss hitting him she slid it was a priceless moment almost taken from a cartoon her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt everyone on the field was already peeling over clutching their stomachs from the laughter but she continued to slide the boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction that is when she took him out too but he was unfortunate enough to land on his face his body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing the game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment we were bRought together by a simple game of fOOTBALL AND uncontrollable laughter,42
12922,Many believe that laughter is the key to the start of a great friendship caPS can mend the broken bridges between people and even make awesome relationships even better Laughter can be such a powerful thing and most don't understand cAPS powerful i eSpecially did not know until two years ago when i met person caps only took the move of my former caps caps to understand daughters full potential of the beginning of a great friendship caps all started a couple weeks before school ended when the news was received at the time i was part of a small caps group in a small church in a small town caps caps person and person were moving and would no longer be able to lead the caps group the entire church congregation was saddened by the sudden news but none were as depressed as the caps that they had touched in their many years in ministry we had grown used to the couple many of the few that had been around the longest including myself had spent nights at their house or in my case babysat their young daughter they were like family to all of us and no one wanted to see them go but sometimes i wonder if they had not what would have happened many well wishes and tears were exchanged between the day they had departed as a congregation everyone thought that no one could ever touch our hearts they way that they had but that was just a thought two short months later word had gotten around that someone from location was travelling here to our small town in location for an interview for the newly open position all the teenagers were guarded the moment that he had walked through the door his name was person only in his early twenties but had quite a lot of experience in ministry my first thought was that this must be some kind of joke caps could he lead a group of kids if hers only a kid himself i was not very keen of him neither was anybody else but something was very different about him he was not afraid to tell us about his life caps he had grown up and seemed to be totally honest with everyone of our questions we asked and that was when we knew as a caps group that maybe he was the one even though i knew person would be our new caps caps i still did not want to accept caps i tried and tried to avoid him although caps always seemed we were having to deal with each other more than either of us wanted to so finally person decided caps was time that the two of us needed to get to know each other one date time my mon got a call from someone at the church she wouldn't tell me who but that i needed to go so i did and who was there person in the sanctuary just the two of us and the associate caps because caps would be too inappropriate for us to be by ourselves your mon did not tell you caps your here did she i laughed caps no she did not caps do you feel you and i talk go hang out wherever you want us oF CAps DO You feel about going to ORGANIZATION The question was puzzling to him caPS Did to most but he accepted the idea caps caPS Are WE Going to ORGANIZATION he said as he pulled into the parking lot I don't know cAPS was just the first thing that popped into my head We both chuckled i felt more at ease with him now and actually thought for the first time that maybe this would be a pretty fun trip As we walked through the building cAPS started to be quite boring bUt the boredom faded away as we decided to pass through the toy aisle and set off all of the toy alarms and sirens Toy after toy had started to go off as we went through the aisle touching every toy that made some kind of absurd noise that would drive anyone up the wall which many did Finally we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other a little better caPS surprised me that both of us liked a lot of the same things He told me more of his childhood like cAPS he was adopted and what capS was like before hand and afterwards caPS Was weird that only a short time ago i dId not want anything to do with perSON and now I was walking around ORGANIZATION laughing and just having a good time tHat was about three years or so ago shOrtly after perSON had to leave mAny rumours were told cAPS because he did not really tell anyone other than the fact that the council had asked him to leave nO matter the reason i still am in touch with him and am glad that the day at ORGANIZATION had happened,38
12923,Though my sister and I have very different personalities and much of the time do not find humour in the same things we have still shared some humorous moments iTs the times you decide to just go with the flow and enjoy someones company instead of letting it bug you one sunny day in location i had some how convinced my sister to go rollerblading with me my dad drove us to a park that had a huge pond in the middle of it the pond was nice in the fact that there was a smooth side walk that circulated all the way around the pond for my sister and i to caps on the pond was not so nice in the fact that it was very littered with ducks ans geese and of course their droppings as well we always thought of the ponds water as one of the most disgusting things on earth we got our roller blades on and carefully stood up our dad was going to take a nap in the car wile we made our laps around the lake as we skated we noticed a man and a woman sharing a date together in a very small boat they were totally unaware that their boat was tipping strongly to one side my sister and i thought it would be hilarious if all of a sudden the boat tipped over we let that thought pass and continued in our rout on our next lap around we heard a woman yelling we looked up and saw that it was the woman who had been in the boat the woman was now standing on the shore yelling at the man to get all her belongings that had fallen out of the boat and were now floating in the gross pond water the man was waiting in the water up to his chest collecting their items and trying to deal with his upside down boat that date was defiantly unsuccessful i thought we could hardly contain our selves from bursting out with laughter we roller bladed back to the car as fast as we could my sister was in front of me and when she tried to stop she couldn't she basically Body slammed the cAR FELL baCk and rolled right underneath it my dad rapidly opened the door to find me crying with laughter we pulled my sister out from under the car and drove home,31

12928,learning to laugh date as we were vacationing in lOCATION I realized that laughter is a big part of our lives and an important factor that can keep friends and families together Not too long ago I also discovered that laughter can relieve you from stress and it even helps you lose weight which i Thought was pretty interesting My sister on the other hand still did not quite believe that laughter could do all of that She thought it was just being blown out of proportion She believed that if her friends did not want to hang around with her then there was something wrong with them that if we did not have enough food in the house it was probably my parents fault there was always some one to blame for whatever happened to her there was always a bad side to everything but that date it was going to be different she was about to find out that she did not have to live her live that way because there is always an alternative the trip to location was something everyone was expecting even me i was actually really excited to see my cousins and the rest of the family everybody packed their things we got ready to leave got on the car and left to the air port my aunt caps was already waiting for us at the location city airport everything was going great so far when we got there my aunt drove all of us to our little town in the state of location just about an hour and a half away from the airport as we were getting there i noticed my sister had a strange look on her face she seemed somehow confused lost in her own thoughts as if she was worried about something caps is wrong with you are you okay you look all weird i said sounding a little sarcastic and hoping to start a conversation caps face is all weird she said and that was the date thing she said to me until we reached our destination as we got to our grandparents house we begun to see all our family members already waiting for us outside the joy of seeing them there was incredible i looked around around and i saw my sister i was glad that she looked happy i thought she was actually enjoying the moment i did not know caps was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little playground my grandma has in the backyard during my time there i met new family members saw some old familiar faces and remembered some good and also bad memories memories which i thought had vanished from my mind already turns out they were still there all the way at the back of my head were i had tried to hide them so that they would never come up again but somehow they managed to get out and make their way into my thoughts again and that is when i started to feel like a monster once again suddenly i had a flash back to the time when we came to visit a couple of years ago that is when it all came to me i saw the whole scene once again i felt horrible there she was my little sister person playing in the swings suddenly she let go of the swing and she felt right into a mud puddle that was there every body laughed i laughed i thought it was funny but she did not laugh she did not cry either she just got up and ran inside i never stopped to ask her if she was okay i did not realize how my actions had affected her it was all my fault i knew she was really sensitive when it came down to some specific situations but i did not help her i did not give her the comfort and support she needed from her big sister so she never learned to laugh at herself and keep going that would have been a nice advice to give her instead of laughing at her then after a couple of minutes of reflection about it i went up to her and apologized she looked a little confused at first but then she realized where i was going this made the rest of the trip a lot more easier now that i knew caps was wrong we both tried our best to fix the problem and work on her self esteem laughter was the perfect therapy for her all she needed to do was to learn how to laugh about her self when things did not go the way she wanted them it was hard but we accomplished our goal my sister discovered the power of laughter and she learned to get back up from her mistakes life taught both of us an important lesson that date i'm sure that was one of the most exciting trips weave ever taken and the memories from that trip will stay with us forever,37

12931,It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together I had the idea to see a movie so i picked a few movies that were in heaters thE choices were between caps CAPS caPS Of the CAPs and another movie that i cant remember wE as a group decided to go to caps OF the caps The movie stars pERSON and caps FROm caps cAPS I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard tHe scene starts out with peRSON And caps WANdering around trying to find a place to stay for the night and they seemed to have cAPS locATION LOcatiON plays an important part on the movie aFter a long day full of scary situations they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night Back tracking a little bit earlier that day and in the movie peRSON came across a native fellow named lOCATION locaTION is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body They came across him while travelling through the desert and saved him from execution for that locATION is very grateful and is cAPS guide around the mysterious caps that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man Back to what i was talking a bot earlier when pERSON and capS end up in the cave the see two full body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it but the record is playing and making music Just a second later lOCATION comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to but in front of the table then locatION does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions basically humping the air Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life To this day i look back at it and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw the movie abOut a month later I went over to one of my good friends houses and we watched the movie again wHen we got to the scene of caPS jig we both fell down off of the couch laughing we Replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard laughTer is good for the soul and moral and for friendship building Thank the cAPS that he made us laugh,34

12935,laughTer means a lot in a relationship in caps oPINIon laughter can mean a few things It can mean that you are having fun and that you re enjoying life all of caps friendships and relationships contain laughter half of the time we laugh the other half we express ourselves laughter could also mean the beginning or ending of a relationship a lot of people would think that laughter is a joyful reaction but sometimes a person could be laughing because they are nervous but i think what we are talking about here is the joyful kind all of caps friendships contain laughter but they also contain the moments when someone needs to be listened to or heard one of caps friendships that contains a lot of laughter is with caps friend person ever since the day that i first met her weave laughed a lot usually its person being the joker and me being the audience along with a few other people but there are also moments that don't have laughing involved moments when person can be a great listener making jokes and gigGling caN SHow how close you are to someone like caps friend pErson and i sheds one of caps closest friends we share everything with each other well at least almost everything we tell each other whats going on in our families and all that good stuff but there are so many moments that are just filled with laughing giggling and making up jokes about caps knows what whether its twisted in some weird way or even when it does not make sense we still laugh about it it does not matter how stupid i month act around her we always laugh it off and make fun of each other not in a bad way usually when people fall down they feel embarrassed or scared of what everyone else would say there was a time that i was sitting on caps friend person is skateboard just sitting and rolling up and down the sidewalk when i came upon a bump i'm pretty sure you could guess what happens next i flew off the skateboard and landed on caps butt on the cement i sat there for a second and just stared shocked that i had flew off of a skateboard while just sitting down pretty disappointing but the next thing i knew i was laughing like it did not even mAtter that i had just landed on caps butt in front of one of caps friends peRson was laughing too i did not mind person did not even tease me about it laughing can shrug things off your shoulders helping you turn it into a joke that is what i did caps relationship with caps caps is full of jokes caps caps is the type of guy caps just loves to tell jokes and or act like some historical figure to confuse people when i answer the phone half of the time caps caps tries to see if i'll fall for one of his little tricks one time he tried saying that he was person and that he invented all these different electrical items i shook caps head was like caps you re not very good at acting caps he said i'm not your caps this is seriously person i laughed and said person is dead how could he be talking to me over thE phOne when hers dead caps i know its you caps caps laughed caps told you i was deAd Obviously I'm still here little lady i sMiled caps hUH Sure And I'm not a little lady caps FINe I give up You can't get a joke can you he said i frowNed Of course I can what are you talking about loCATION Its Just you re not very good at acting caps sure blame it on me he laughed whereas your mother that is when the joke ended of course but caps caps and i actually have a strong relationship hers caps adopted caps in case that has not been mentioned so when i first met him we were not as close as you could probably guess but after a year we got closer and i learned that i could trust him and that half of what he says is basically a joke sometimes i wonder if he ever knows how to be serious so he does not confuse people for example me for me relationships should always have laughter otherwise it just makes it all serious making it very hard to stay close in caps opinion and me myself i like laughing and having close friends because when i'm feeling down its always nice to have someone there to make you smile and laugh its a great quality to be able to laugh and help people without laughter in the world like i said before the world would be too serious way too serious caps would want that i wouldn't that would be terrible when people laugh it makes the world a better place to live in in caps opinion laUGHIng is a gift a very special gift,40
12936,To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them lAughter moNTH some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as cAPS someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when cAPS hurt them When I can make someone else laugh or giggle cAPS not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to caPS shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy cAPS of us I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset And when someone asks him what Is wrong or cAPS he Is okay cAPS seems that he just gets more angry sO me being one of his closer friends i try and help him with that and so far capS has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together aNd by him being iN a better mood caPS makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable and for all the others that are around him capS I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that cAPS brings people closer so use caps don't be afraid,30
12937,lAughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people closer connecting them between something they have in common forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them laughter is the glue that holds together any relationship and keeps a person from breaking into tears when something wrong happens In fact without laughter I probably would not even get through my day to day school life wIthout laughter one class in particular would be a nightmare in ORGANIZATION we are dissecting cats and we are working with a partner if I was not making jokes and laughing while I worked my partner and I would have hated each other We got to choose our partner and work at a lab station with another pair of students fortunately for me I knew all of the people I was working near and with and i was friends with all of them we had to wear gloves and suits so we did not get fluids or cat juices on us fiRst we had to skin the cat of course there is more than one way to do this you can cut slice rip and pull to remove the skin Then we had to view and identify the muscles this was especially hard because we could not tell where one muscle begins and another ends Next we had to remove the muscles and identify the bones and digestive organs After we identified the bones and digestive organs we had to remove them and view the stomach liver intestines and kidneys wE had to cut open the stomach intestines and kidneys to look at the structure of them lastly we had to remove the heart and lungs The class was told we are doing dissections for about a month and it has only been three weeks You can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much I need laughter to keep myself together and from going insane My friends keep me from breaking into tears and keep me laughing diSsecting cats in ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION was challenging not only physically but mentally challenging as well it Stressful fascinating and gross and without the jokes and the laughter I do not think I would have never made it through it mY friends support there when i needed it guided me through the terrible assignment so as you can clearly see without laughter i wOuld not be able to do some of the day to day things i dO at school,40
12938,A couple years ago when I was in middle school I meet one of my best friend which who I have great times with wHen i first meet her was in match class where she had an assigned seat next to me We started talking and even though we did it know each other very well i could say laughter was the closest distance between me and her We would just laugh at really random things that happened because we did it really know what to talk about sometimes it wouldn't make since of what we were laughing about but we laughed any way even though we did it understand each others jokes laughIng was something that keyed our distance close time went by and we became good friends laughing was the one thing that keyed us code together because we had nothing better to do we both are people that like to laugh a lot and if not we get bored if me or her had no humour when we first meet i don't think we would of got along so well at the enD we did it really have anything to do because we did it know each other very good we would only hang out during lunch and any other class we had together but all we did was laugh at what we thought was funny which was really dumb we had nothing better to do a couple months latter we seemed to become really close friends and not just in laughter we knew each other much better and finally had things to talk about and we found out we had something in common laughter still had something to do with our friendship but not as much as the beginning of when we first meet during mAtch time we were always talking and laughing at the things we would say That had never happened before But now we were able to talk about other things too not just things that made us laugh and we new that laughter is it the only thing that is keeping us close together now we had other ways to get along too we both had friends that we could get along with differently i had some friends with not a really close distance but we would laugh a lot with some of my other friends i did it really laugh that much and we had a very close friendship my friends and i can get along in different ways not just in laughter we all have different ways to get along and have fun some of them are really calm and some of them like to laugh a lot like me mostly all of the are just the type that like to be laughing all the time but we are closer because of the way we are with each other i think that laughing could be the shortest distance between two people there are other things that can keep two people close together laughing does help people have a good time together but i don't think is a big big part of a friendship i tHink its how they get along and if the hAve somethings on common it also depenDs on how they Get along and how they treat each other everybody has a different way of what keeps them close to a friend so i think its different for everybody,32
12939,One day when i was going to school with my friends i step to in dog poo and all of my friends laughed at me and it was so embarrassing and i was so mad that my shoes was dirty and now i had to go back home and clean my shoes that i just got for my birthday and now i had to tell my mon that i got dog poo on my shoes and when i told my mon was not mad at me i wood think that she wood be mad at me because she worker to to get the money to pay for my shoes The next day i went to school all of my friends laughing at me i just went to my class and sat down and stared my match work and when my best friend came up to me and said did you really step in dog poo and she gave a peace of paper that had a dog pooping on a girl and i got so mad i stared craning When i went home after school mon ask me how school weNt i did not wont to tell her that my whole day was bad everyone was laughing at me So i just that school was good and she told me that all people are not good,27
12940,Laughter to me seems like the foundation of a relationship if it is a relationship with your parents best friend or your spouse it can all be formed with a single laugh or giggle I have seen on cAPS that when a guy try a to pick up or hit on a girl most of the time he will try to be funny to break the ice whEn that so called ice is broken the air is open for both people to start showing each who they are My best friend and I have been friends for five years now and I hope that we will be friends for more years to come peRSON My best friend and only friend has shown me how to be myself percenT WITH her and try to with others together Person and I have had many funny adventures together that i will cherish for the rest of my life Just recently pERSON and i Went snowboarding at locATION IN locatION CAPS was her second time going snowboarding and I have been snowboarding for about three years now i promised her that i would stay and help her on the slopes until she got the hang of the board under her feet i Also promised that i Would fall down with her when she fell wheN we got there i sHowed her how to clip her bindings on what the stomp pad was used for and also how to skate The word skate means that your foot boot is in the front binding and your left foot is not you push your back foot on the snow to slide or skate on to the ski lift It took us three hours to get down the first bunny hill slope normally it takes a person no more than ten minutes to get down wHile teaching laughing and bonding with persoN I noticed that when I laugh with her I get feelings of love caring and happiness Laughing with her always makes my day iN fact that is how we became friends was by laughing together aftEr we got of the slope she said some words to me that i wIll not forget caps you are the best friend I could ever ask for if you were a man I would marry you and have your children I love you capS MEant a lot to me for person is the kind of person that keeps her feelings of love and caring inside caPS was the first time she has ever said she loves me Laughing together for five years now has made it so that pERSON feels more open with me enough to say something that she never told to her family Laughing and even giggling together is what pERSON and I look forward to in our relationship,36

12942,lAughter what is laughter Do you expect me to tell you what laughter is I wish I could but I can't describing laughter is like describing what water taste like or feels like besides using the word wet its just one of those things that you think its easy to describe to someone because its a part of your every day life but in reality its one of the most complex things there could be out there even though i can't describe it i do have general concept of it now there is many reasons to laugh or the type of laughter or the feeling behind it in my case i believe i'm a person that caps caps laughs once a day i laugh all the time from my friend falling hearing a joke remembering something in the past from just pure exhaustion yes i laugh caps times when i'm just so worn out and stressed the list goes on and on in short i live my life laughing every day i don't think i'm such a happy go lucky person that makes others laugh alongside her but i have gotten comments from my friends saying that is the case this is one of the wonders of laughter if you see someone laughing enjoying their time you just somehow end up laughing along side them it makes me happy when i hear one of my friends say of person you just made my day why it makes me happy because i know that that friend just now i was able to make even if just a little a nice day one time in my life though i met someone someone that now i hold very dear someone who i just can't picture my life without that someone would be right to say he lost his laughter it was date and my friend caps had invited me to the caps caps in caps to meet up with some of her caps friends the reunion with her friends was caps this coffee shop i knew no one but her so i felt out of place so after just sitting back like a wall flower i decided to go to the ice cream shop just next to the coffee shop and when i rEALIZED ONE OF THE BOYS IN OUR GROUP DECIDED TO COME AS WELL WE HANGED OUT HE TOLD ME ABOUT HIMSELF I TOLD HIM ABOUT MYSELF AS WELL AFTER THAT DAY WE STAYED CONNECTED WE HAD LONG HOUR CONversations Through this video calling site called oRganization we chatted in caps caps everY singled day and pULLEd aLL Fighters on the phone just talking to each other after around a month of talking and staying connected we became more close close enough for him to talk about more serious matters with me well now this boy i hold very dear to me has had such a hard life where could i possibly begin to tell you the hardships his been through of what about the fact that his adoptive hmm nah many people out there are adopted that is not that harsh for most okay what about the fact that his adoptive father abused of him every chance he got and his adoptive mon literally sat back and watched him do it not good enough okay what about the fact that the one thing that kept him going his friend the one that was all ways next to him his to say child hood friends the child hood friend you can do caps in the world yet would not judge would not think the worst of you if you did something to be ashamed of the one that was willing to stay up with you for days in a row just for you not to cry your self to sleep that friend of him passed away in a car rec in his second year of middle school his life consisted of waking up in the mornings walking to school and being ignore by everyone around him coming back from school and putting up with your adoptive family screaming caps him called him names ending up to being beaten just because they can do you think he laughed well actually he did but his laugh was not a laugh of joy even though he laughed it was as if nothing no feeling what so ever was behind that laugh a robotic laugh this for me is such a hard thing to stand it tears me up because this person is someone very dear to me his such a wonderful individual his just now part of my life and i cant see him out of it now yet he is suffering he cant even laugh and feel joy up to this day i still see him and i have decide that one day for sure i will make him laugh we laugh when we talk but i want him to experience the lAugh he hAS Yet to have experience and i knOw one day for sure he will,30
12943,wHen i think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in ORGANIZATION thE happiest time started with us pulling up to the house as i slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases mY caPS Caps CAMe to the door first to greet us I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw pERSON sleeping on the coach He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him every time hE had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plan tucked in shirt We always played gold fish together every time I came over any time of the day I was so excited to see him I started to run awards him when my other cousin pERSON grabs me and starts to tickle me tell i Fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter my Laughing woke up persON as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from lOCATION he Put me on the couch and started watching caps TELl i feeL asleep The next morning I woke up to hear coyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchen shot up to eat breakfast my dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm aroUnd lunch time while my mon and persON WERe cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch lunch Was not ready right then so person and i started to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat after lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curl up by the bales almost every foot step we took there was another snake curl up in the bales every time person would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head after hunting person figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard i was not to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and person jumped out of her chair and started running to the house everyone started to laugh when person cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard person finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack we all came back inside to visit in the house person and i headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit the next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm i went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done when we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as i stood by person not wanting to leave but my mon said i couldn't stay so she picked me UP ANd put Me in the car as we pulled away i looked back to see them all waving good bye after we visited datE WE Got a call from my caps person with some bad news person was hEading home and SAW Caps truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he grAduated we went to the funeral that date and when it was all done i sAT IN caps room and only could remember all the laughs we shared i KNEW TO ALWAYS LAUGH AND ALWAYS TO REMEMBER THE GREAT TIMES I HAD WITH ONE TRUE MY BEST FRIEND MY MEMORY OF HIM HAS NOT GONE AWAY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AND BECAUSE OF HIM I ALWAYS LAUGH WHEN I CAN LAUGH AND LIve to the fullest he taught me SO MUCh from the little time he was he but whenever i need a laugh i think of the last tiMe i saw him,39
12944,I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier iTs better to laugh at something that is bad like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake it makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life one thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends they make everything easier for me by making me laugh they don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that especially when in not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood they say something that all make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again most simple things make me laugh more and be happy like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laughs but me but one thing that normally does not make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad like if they tripped i wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt i always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them like for example if they talk about they did over the date and how high or Drunk they got its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it i never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me why would i wanna hear about hOw your ruining your life especially at a young age or even at all well that is my story and why i tHink the benefits or laughter is important,30

12946,wE all understand the benefits of laughter laUghter is definitely the most important part of my best friends and i Relationship witHout laughter we couldn't possibly have as much fun together as we do If I am having a bad day I can always count on my best friend to make me crack up and forget about the day I have had iF we are out and about or just relaxing at home my best friend and i are always laughing The end result is usually us both with tear streaked faces from laughing so hard There are actually quite a few different instances in which I remember laughing particularity hard tHis last caPS Caps IS eve for example it started snowing at around three am so my best friend and i ran outside screaming at the top of our lungs snowballs started coming from every direction during a game of hide and go seek we decided to bury ourselves in a snow covered leaf pile within ten minutes our legs were freezing so what did we do we put on our swim suits and jumped into the bath tub together having her there to laugh with me made the situation a lot better another situation in which i remember being particularly funny was the entire third trimester of freshman caps i needed a first period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing i definitely was not looking forward to it until i found out that my best friend had it with me we made a bad situation a lot better by laughing at every single stupid mistake we made since we are not exactly experienced in the field of metal there were quite a few mistakes with out my best friend there to laugh with me i have no idea what i would have done i believe that whenever i am in a bad situation laughter will always help me one last situation in which laughter helped a lot is when i used it to cheer up my best friend a couple of days ago my friend had had a really bad day things just were not going her way after school i could tell something was wrong i tried talking to her about it but that was not really helping so i brought up some of our past experiences together within a few minutes she was laughing and i could tell she felt a lot better laughter really does help us out of some tough situations laughter is by far the most important factor in my best friends and i relationship our relationship is mainly based on laughter without it we just wouldn't be as close as we are today if we need it to cheer each other up or cure boredoM i know that laughter will always be on our side,40

12948,Have you ever experienced a time with your friends or family where you laughed so hard your stomach hurt and your eyes were filled with tears Laughing is something every person needs A great laugh can make a persons day and put a smile on their face If no one laughed the world would be a terribly sad place My friends and I are always laughing to the point where were rolling on the ground clutching our stomachs laughing We sometimes laugh over absolutely nothing I honestly don't know who Id be if I did not laugh or what I would become I remember this one time when my friends cAPS and perSON and I were having a off day We all woke up in bad moods and everything seemed to be going wrong especially since we were woken up by my mon in the kitchen banging pans and pots around When we woke up our favourite cereal was gone and so we wanted to go to the donuts shop but no one would take us and even though I realize that is not the end of the world now it seemed like it then mY brother and sisters with the locATION BLasting and running around the house yelling were irritating us and we were already mad the doG and cats who kept trying to keep sneak in the house were annoying us too thE weather outside was all gloomy and disappointing We were all ready done with the day before it had even started We eventually decided to get up and get ready We came up with a plan to walk down to river behind my house even in the poor weather The river was after our big backyard and past the quad track so it was about a mile away When we asked my mon if we could go down to the river she said no she did not want us walking down there by ourselves which we had already done a few times before We begged until we knew she was not going to let us That put us yet again in a foul mood We had to go find something new to do and it did not seem like there was many options We lived clear out of town about nUMB miles not exactly walking distance,36

12958,One thing that people in the world love to do the most is laugh Why is it that we like to laugh Laughter is every important in our lives because it brings us joy happiness and most of all it just fills our stomachs with butterflies One major thing that about laughter is the whole point of view Of course everyone makes jokes dorky things or simply a funny comment alL those things cause laughter sometimes laughter helps people grow a good relationship and it builds up to be strong In relationships like boyfriend girlfriend parents with their children family or even friends have to have some laughter in their relationship because if not then that would be a boring relationship aT times its hard to bring laughter in the picture but we at least need to try to laugh it is healthy for us to laugh once in a while in families its important to grow a relationship with the child or parents and they need some funny feelings in their stomachs that make them giggly inside and its all could laughter friends always will have funny moments to laugh about its sometimes the pranks that they do to each other the funny comments the jokes and its easy as that to start laughing and creating the good relationship with just laughing with each other sometimes laughter could cause bad things if we use for bad things and that could cause a bad relationship we also don't want to hurt someones feelings by laughing at them because something that happen or if someone made a comment because that could leave us not laughing to much after we loose a relationship with someone the smiles that people have on their faces is a wonderful thing to see in all relationships laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handle people have bad days sometimes and we always try to make them happy and how do we do that well its calleD laughing i know if i was having a bad day and i felt all depressed and mushy i would like someone to make me laugh by simply saying a hilarious joke in my personal opinion i love laughing and especially making people around me laugh at times i have my bad times and need some laughter in my system to make me feel at least better i know that sadness can sometimes take over but we all need to think positive and not let the negative things take over life is so much better if we all have laughter in them imagine the world with just laughter how life would be i wish that could happen because that would make everyone full of happiness and smiles on the faces in my personal life mY family and friends are full of laughter i have to make jokes at times when things are gettiNg difficult and everyone is freaking out laughter is a part of us either we like it or not its always going to be with us no matter what eventually i would sAy that laughter is a element iN my life that i will always carry and i hope that everyone in the world has the element of laughter in them bEcause seRiously its important in this this world,40

12964,mOrose and somnolent I woke up I woke up to go to lOCATION goiNg to locaTION to watch a few basketball games i was Although I was unable to partake in the activity because I was CAPS injured in the previous week of practice uNfortunately though I still had to go and support my friends and teammates iT was about nuMB of clock when we all got onto the bus and set off to location all of my friends were mirthful and talkative but me on the other hand i was in a lackadaisical stare the bus ride seemed to last a whole lifetime but in two hours we arrived at our destination location had a nice school but we were all about to find that it sometimes resembled a ghost town the high school seemed lifeless in comparison with other schools we had played at in the past there was nobody around and not a soul to be heard we all sat there patiently waiting then after maybe five minutes or so a man showed up and led us to the locker rooms the boys had to wait till the girls were done playing their game so we all went and started shooting on one of the auxiliary courts although sadly due to my injury i could not participate in the activity they were all having so much fun screwing around down there just the thought of not being down there with them made me ill after the girls game we all went to change after that we all sat there joking around and waiting for our coach to come in and give us our are game pep talk it seemed like ages before our coach finally came into the locker room he talked about what we should and shouldn't do in order to get the win when the game started i was really getting depressed but i sucked it up and cheered on my team the first half OF THE gamE was great and we were on top although the second half was not so great we only scored six points and ended up losing the game by a large margin my friends tried to be stoical but i could tell that they were ashamed ashamed of their performance in the second half this once again made me feel sad and depressed next i had no choice but to go and watch two more games in the old vulgar and uncomfortable bleachers of location the first of the two games was a great one we won by two points the next game on the other hand was a very boring one it seemed to take forever but the worst of it was thE fact that we lost after that final game i had to wait for my cousin to come out from the locker room when he dId we went to check out with our coaches we had to check out in order to ride home with our parents so off we went but first we had to get something to eat once again like all the times before we chose to eat at organization we went through the drive through got our food tHEN pulled over so we could eat at first everything seemed right but then my cousin noticed he did not receive the caps he ordered so we went in to get the probleM solved afterwords we were all kind of joking about the restaurant not getting the order right then i took a bite of my burger it was then that i realized i had received a burger without a patty i was really upset that organization is made such a silly mistake so once more me and my cousin went in to the restaurant when told what the problem was they were all just in shock they couldn't believe what they had done so after they all settled down they made me another burger me and and the family were all having a ball about the events at the organization it was a great trip home filled with lots of fun and laughter which was not what me my cousin or anybody else expected So in the end of my once gloomy day I found myself stricken with laughter,36

12973,When you laugh is caPS out of habit or is caPS Cause what are the causes for laughing is caPs even such a thing as a cause for laughter I'm sure that if you were to get a scientists opinion you would be given an in depth technical explanation for the cause of laughter but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles certainly not the true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh so what makes people laugh a funny joke a senseless action a misunderstanding caps can be anything without a doubt one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two date caps older sister person and i unknowingly went out on an adventure we were headed to location location to visit our very best friends person and person who happened to be almost completely identical to caps sister and i in personality person being like person and person being like me now whenever the four of us got together caps was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with all we knew was that hanging out together caps failed to brighten up our days and put a smile on our faces this particular day both person and i were in desperate need of each others full attention and up lifting spirits she and i had both been going through a rough patch with some friends at our schools oddly enough we were both having friendship issues with someone named person and we did not even go to the same school so after some discussion between both of our sets of parents they agreed to have person pick up location person pick me up and well all meet somewhere to take our minds off the antagonizing situations were were both suffering through we decided to meet in location at person and person is house when we pulled into their drive way i could feel caps body being filled with excitement as if the emotion was trapped inside some kind of storage container inside of me that was too small to hold all the contents that were being held inside before the car engine was completely turned off caps seat belt was off and i was half way out of the car door i slammed caps shut once caps body had slithered its way free and ran for the door to caps surprise caps was unlocked i pushed caps open obnoxiously yelling i'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee caps was a cry of laughter that filled the room i hugged both of them in one tight squeeze and almost as if person and i had our very next move planned out we immediately began chattering about the incidents that had occUrred that day As we took a seat on the couch all that could be heard was caps caps caps i have to tell you what happened today and i can't believe she said that or and she said and then i was like so then she says caps was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama ridden teen straight out of the movies things were going as they normally would have person and person dwelling close to person and i in the dining room located at the far end of the couch where she and i sat still completely involved in our similar freshman year of high school worlds they were completely immersed in their own conversations of old memories wed had together all of a sudden person shouts caps person and i baked you brownies caps off guard by his interjection we all once again fell into laughter although this time making our way toward the kitchen in search of SAID brownies when we arrived caps sat a pan of brownies on the middle counter person uncovered caps and gave us each a napkin with which a brownie sat on top we stood together leaning against the tile counters enjoying our brownies and the company of one another suddenly caps was a dull moment no one was saying anything as if to fill the silence before a timer ran out person blurted out person do you wear a wig caps in our lives have any of us laughed as hard as we did aT THat mOMENt person fell to THE Ground Person and person were leaning upon each other for support to keep from falling and i was completely doubled over tryinG desperately to keEP THE Sip oF MILK I had just taken inside of caps mouth minutes creeper by and we were still laughing at the off key remark to this day person and i remedies upon that afternoon and the laughter that was shared upon us and our very very best friends,40
12974,tripping on fences i am numb yeArs young and in those short numb years all i can ever remember is laughing hysterically whether it was about something stupid i did or my best friend doing something stupid or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous someone once said laughter is the shortest distance between two people with my best friend organization and i that is exactly the case i always get a good a workout whenever i'm with her BecausE I'm always bursting with laughter it WAs my numb graDe year at organization here in location organization i was hanging out with my best friend organization during our lunch break outside i was showing her my new jeans id just gotten the day before at location i was also telling her about a note that had been passed to me by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for sometime this boy had also asked me out on the note organization had asked me if she could see it when i handed it over to her all of a sudden she chucked tHe note over the fence clearly the guy did not have ORGANIZATION is apProval i couldn't just leave the guy hanging without an answer especially when at the time i liked him back i begged organization to give me my note back but she refused what was i supposed to do just let an unanswered note lay on the other side of the fence no the only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it so i in my new jeans might i add practically straddled the fence and ripped a big hole on the inner side of my thigh in my brand new jeans i was so mad i grabbed the note and climbed back over the fence in my new and improved hobo jeans on my way back over i lost my balance and fell of the fence i ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones what an idiot i was id climbed over that stupid fence ripped my jeans miffed it and lost my balance and lost it again i was so frustrated with myself i started laughing I'm not sure if it was because i was embarrassed or what but i randomly started cracking up then organization started laughing and when she laughs i laugh because her laughter is so contagious pretty soon we were both hysterically laughing like a couple of dorks laughter really was the shortest distance between two people that day even though i probably should have been mad but why do that when caps can just laugh about it that is what life is all about living with this silly but funny memory I'll stay with me forever especiallY now that ORGANIZATION has moved AWAY IT month seem stupid but it was funny to us i guess it really was one of those caps had to be there kind of moments but it reminds me of the good old days with ORGANIZATION itS good to have memories filled with lauGHTER IF CAPs don't your life can almost feel Dull without it even if caps laugh at just tHe smallest things in life that is wHY TO ME anYways laughter is the shortest distance between two people,40
12975,Many people believe that laughter can improve your life Laughing lets out endorphins that give your body energy for daily activities rElationships are usually better if both the people are happy Happiness is like shaking up a soda bottle Happy emotions build up in your body and when shaken release with an explosion of positive emotions such as laughing wHen i was born my mother said that i Was the most chubby baby in the world as She said this she laughed in constant thought that I will eventually become a young adult I giggled in the backseat of the car as we drove home together i was taught by my mother who laughed all the time until her eyes were full of tears to laugh at every chance I had tHrough my years as an infant i Giggled chuckled and laughed my way to adolescence As I moved into adolescence i was diagnosed with ORGANIZATION is caps a mild autistic caps that has a variation of side effects some people who have organization is caps develop cases where their emotions do not show physically this case is similar to the physical features of caps caps my main case with having organization is caps is that i do not receive all the information given to me at one time when people tell me a joke that they think is hilarious i tend to miss the important parts of the joke which are funny as the joke comes to an end everybody around me is laughing but i am standing there with a blank look on my face sometimes i tell people i cannot laugh though i say this i know it is not true i can laugh it is just really hard for me to find the right time most times i laugh at a situation that really is not funny and everybody else has a blank gaze on their face this usually makes me feel embarrassed and i don't fEEL normal a lot of peopLE Tell me i look expressionless and then try to perk me up or smile i don't feel the need to smile even in happy times in my liFe i have not laughed enough but have been learning in how to make bad situations into great and happy ones learning that at any moment i can laugh is important even if there is no joke being told i can laugh most people would probably look a me in a weird way but i wouldn't care because i am the one that feels happiness inside laughing relieves stress makes other people feel good and allows people with mental disabilities to feel more comfortable in the community they live in i have finally learned that even with ORGANIZATION is cAPS i can laugh just as much as anyone,40

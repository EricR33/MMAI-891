# MMAI-891
Natural Language Processing:
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the development of an NLP solution for grading essay submissions.

The final submission files for MMAI-891 NLP are the following:
1) Modelling / Final_Preprocessing.py   --> This is the combined preprocessing file
2) Modelling / GLOVE_LSTM_NN_Model.py     --> This is the final recommended NN for the project
3) Modelling / LSTM_NN_Model.py         --> This is the baseline NN
4) Modelling / NN_Models.py             --> This contains all NN models including the final solution
5) Modelling / ML_Models.py             --> This is the Linear Regression & Gradient Boosting                                                          Regressor models
6) Modelling / training_2-LSTM.zip      --> This is the saved weights for the GLOVE_LSTM_NN_Model.py file
7) big.txt        --> This is the dictionary used to calculate the number of mispelled words


Instructions to run GLOVE_LSTM_NN_Model.py File
#1) Save the clean version of Kaggle dataset (Modelling / new_df-5.csv) in "gdrive/My Drive/MMAI891/" in Google Drive; unzip Modelling /  training_2-LSTM.zip and save the weights in "gdrive/My Drive/MMAI891/training_2/" in Google Drive
#2) Run this code inside Google Colab. There might be slight differences if attempted to run on a Python IDE
#3) All attempted models are saved in  Modelling / NN_Models.py

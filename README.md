# MMAI-891
Natural Language Preprocessing
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the development of an NLP solution for grading essay submissions.

The final submission files for MMAI-891 NLP are the following:
1) Modelling / Final_Preprocessing.py   --> This is the combined preprocessing file
2) Modelling / GLOVE_LSTM_NN_Model.py   --> This is the final recommended NN for the project
3) Modelling / LSTM_NN_Model.py         --> This is the baseline NN
4) Modelling / ML_Models.py             --> This is the Linear Regression & Gradient Boosting               .                                           Regressor models
5) Modelling / training_2-LSTM.zip      --> This is the saved weights for the GLOVE_LSTM_NN_Model.py file
